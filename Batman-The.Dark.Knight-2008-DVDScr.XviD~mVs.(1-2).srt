They crossed a line.

You crossed the line first.

796

You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

797
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:04,942
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

With respect, Master Wayne...

801
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:15,091
perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

802
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,247
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

803
00:54:18,248 --> 00:54:21,834
and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

804
00:54:21,835 --> 00:54:24,586
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

805
00:54:24,587 --> 00:54:27,589
by bribing them with
precious stones...

806
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:32,344
but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

807
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:36,015
So we went looking for the stones.

808
00:54:36,016 --> 00:54:41,662
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

809
00:54:41,771 --> 00:54:45,941
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

810
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:49,236
the size of a tangerine.

811
00:54:49,237 --> 00:54:53,128
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

812
00:54:53,283 --> 00:54:56,160
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

813
00:54:56,161 --> 00:55:01,290
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

814
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:05,961
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.
