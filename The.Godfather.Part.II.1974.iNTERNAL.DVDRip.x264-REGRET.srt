1
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,157
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,035
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,391
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,199
My son...

5
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,030
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,988
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,750
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,875
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,476
But Vito is only nine
and dumb-witted.

10
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,873
He never speaks.

11
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,555
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,429
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,839
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,750
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,317
When he's a man,
he'll come for revenge.

16
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,033
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,671
He's all I have left.

18
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,869
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,795
Vito, run!

20
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,909
Move and I'll kill him!

21
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,239
Run, Vito!

22
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,949
Kill him!

23
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,317
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

24
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,708
You understand?

25
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,351
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

26
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,470
Vito, we're praying for you!

27
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,349
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

28
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,158
...turn him over to us.

29
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,514
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

30
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,678
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

31
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,677
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

32
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,958
Nurse.

33
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,592
Money?

34
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,711
Interpreter!

35
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,109
Where are you from?

36
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,436
- What is your name?
- Maria.

37
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,756
What is your name?

38
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,912
Come on, son. What is your name?

39
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,878
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

40
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,148
Corleone. Vito Corleone.

41
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,148
Okay, over there.

42
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,195
Next.

43
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,432
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

44
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,229
Vito Corleone!

45
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,190
Vito Corleone!

46
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,235
Here he is. This is him.

47
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,516
Did you bring the car keys?

48
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,988
Laurie! Laurie!

49
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,636
Mama!

50
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,312
Mama!

51
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,794
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

52
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,992
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

53
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,592
Mama!

54
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,559
- Here I am.
- Constanzia, after one week?

55
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,514
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.

56
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,317
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. This is for my mama!

57
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,432
- What is this?
- You remember Merle?

58
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,200
Hello. How are you? Thank you.

59
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,633
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him
and I can't wait on line.

60
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,990
You go see your children first.

61
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,478
Then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.

62
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,475
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

63
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,440
<i>A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.</i>

64
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,639
<i>Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.</i>

65
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,399
<i>And there is Mrs Geary.</i>

66
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,316
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

67
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,914
<i>This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs Geary.</i>

68
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,512
<i>We see Nevada far too seldom.</i>

69
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,350
<i>But today we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends</i>

70
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,155
<i>and we help celebrate
a young man's first Communion.</i>

71
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,599
<i>And also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the State.</i>

72
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,238
<i>I have here in my hand a cheque
made out to the university</i>

73
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,956
<i>and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of</i>

74
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,954
<i>Anthony Vito Corleone.</i>

75
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,958
<i>The cheque is signed by
that young man's parents</i>

76
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,754
<i>whom I think we should recognise.</i>

77
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,078
<i>Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!</i>

78
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,111
<i>Folks, I want you to join me</i>

79
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,758
<i>in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr and Mrs Michael Corleone!</i>

80
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,514
<i>We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir</i>

81
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,750
<i>who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement</i>

82
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,668
<i>to honour their host,
Mr Michael Corleone.</i>

83
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,279
<i>Boys.</i>

84
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,151
The plaque.

85
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,749
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?

86
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,631
Okay, that's good.

87
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,674
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs Corleone.

88
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,153
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.

89
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,352
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.

90
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,472
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

91
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,836
I thought that you and I
would talk alone.

92
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,792
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.

93
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,718
Well, it's perfectly all right with me

94
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,277
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.

95
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,277
Maybe more frankly

96
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,551
than anyone in my position
has ever talked to you before.

97
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,593
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.

98
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,669
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas

99
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,112
and one in Reno.
The licences were grandfathered in

100
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,471
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

101
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,273
Now my sources tell me

102
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,279
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

103
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,235
They tell me that within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.

104
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,798
Quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with a little technical problem.

105
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,199
The licence will still be
in Klingman's name.

106
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,552
- Turnbull is a good man.
- Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.

107
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,717
I don't want to spend
more time here than I have to.

108
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,149
You can have the licence.

109
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,953
The price is 250,000 dollars.

110
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,594
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly

111
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,998
of all four hotels, Mr Corleone.

112
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,190
The price for the licence
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?

113
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,550
That's right.

114
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,959
- Why would I pay more than that?
- Because I intend to squeeze you.

115
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,594
I don't like your kind of people.

116
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,953
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair

117
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,310
dressed up in those silk suits

118
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,194
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

119
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,713
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

120
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,039
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.

121
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,998
Senator,

122
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,158
we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

123
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,790
But never think it applies to my family.

124
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,795
All right, all right.

125
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,509
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

126
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,473
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.

127
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,398
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.

128
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,910
Don't you contact me again, ever.

129
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,669
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

130
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,829
Senator, you can have
my answer now if you like.

131
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,033
My offer is this...

132
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,719
Nothing.

133
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,758
Not even the fee for the gaming licence,
which I would like you to put up.

134
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,309
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

135
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,354
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.

136
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,358
- Honey, we have to go.
- Really? I'm sorry.

137
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,711
- It's been delightful.
- It was our pleasure.

138
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,388
It was wonderful talking to you.

139
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,069
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!

140
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,997
Frank Pentangeli!

141
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,112
I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!

142
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,714
I've got to check on my boys.

143
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,757
- What's with the food here?
- What's the matter?

144
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,432
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker
with chopped liver and says, "canapés".

145
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,589
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"

146
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,758
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

147
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,517
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

148
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,953
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

149
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,431
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?

150
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,472
No, that was no heart attack.

151
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,628
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

152
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,672
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

153
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,920
Do I have to get a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

154
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,432
- You can't get in to see Mike?
- He's got me waiting in a lobby!

155
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,912
- Johnny Ola.
- Al Neri.

156
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,353
- Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
- I remember Tom from the old days.

157
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,959
Rocco.

158
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,789
- What's this?
- It's an orange from Miami.

159
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,832
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

160
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,915
Johnny?

161
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,839
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.

162
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,671
Sure, Mike.

163
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,911
- What are you drinking, Johnny?
- Anisette.

164
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,829
- If you need anything, I'll be outside.
- Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.

165
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,799
- I just left Mr Roth in Miami.
- How is his health?

166
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,717
It's not good.

167
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,275
Can I do anything or send anything?

168
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,030
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

169
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,952
That casino...

170
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,517
Registered owners. Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.

171
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,313
The real owners are
the old Lakeville Road group

172
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,590
and our friend in Miami.

173
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,477
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of
it too, but I've been instructed to tell you

174
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,479
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

175
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,157
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.

176
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,995
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

177
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,910
One by one, our old friends are gone.

178
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,591
Death, natural or not,

179
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,314
prison, deported...

180
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,794
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.

181
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,878
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one Italian!

182
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,514
Let's have a tarantella!

183
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,916
You! Up, up, up!

184
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,639
<i>Questa mano!</i>

185
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,671
<i>Questa mano!</i>

186
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,078
What the hell have we here?

187
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,078
- I'll see my sister alone.
- It concerns me too. May I stay?

188
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,159
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.

189
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,272
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink?

190
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,875
Al, please get him a drink!

191
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,755
<i>We're going to Europe. I'd like to book
passage on The Queen.</i>

192
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,599
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

193
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,518
We're getting married first.

194
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,919
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

195
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,595
You see your children on weekends.

196
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,430
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno
for a theft you don't even know about.

197
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,711
You fly around the world
with men who use you like a whore!

198
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,229
- You're not my father!
- So why come to me?

199
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,679
I need money.

200
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,194
Connie, Connie, Connie...

201
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,989
I want to be reasonable with you.

202
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,674
Why don't you stay with the family?

203
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,354
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

204
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,916
You won't be deprived of anything.

205
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,439
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.

206
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,715
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him any more.

207
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,916
He'll understand, believe me.

208
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,591
Connie.

209
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,479
If you don't listen to me
and marry this man,

210
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,915
you'll disappoint me.

211
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,199
<i>- Famiglia!
- Cent'anni!</i>

212
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,876
What's "Chen dannay"?

213
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,833
"Cent' anni". It means 100 years.

214
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,033
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.

215
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,039
- It would be true if my father were alive.
- Connie.

216
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,639
Hey...

217
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,355
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law,
Deanna.

218
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,038
- Fredo's wife.
- My pleasure.

219
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,989
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

220
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,159
I know, I know.

221
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,155
- I just want to dance!
- You're falling all over the floor.

222
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,909
You're just jealous
because he's a real man!

223
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,591
- I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
- You couldn't belt your mama!

224
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,476
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.

225
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,276
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

226
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,153
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop.

227
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,593
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!

228
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,628
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

229
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,875
Fredo!

230
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,596
- I can't control her, Mikey.
- You're my brother, don't apologise.

231
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,279
Clemenza promised the Rosato
brothers three territories after he died.

232
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,753
You took over and didn't give it to them.

233
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,074
I welched.

234
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,432
<i>Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.</i>

235
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,915
- He hated them more than I do.
- Frankie, they feel cheated.

236
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,799
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains
and you're drinking...

237
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,115
- What's he drinking?
- Champagne.

238
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,110
Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgement on how I run my family.

239
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,912
Your family's still called Corleone.

240
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,992
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

241
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,910
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

242
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,993
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

243
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,078
...with Hyman Roth!

244
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,512
You're a good old man and I like you.

245
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,915
You were loyal to my father for years.

246
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,308
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.

247
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,112
They spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

248
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,959
I know. That's why
I don't want them touched.

249
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,755
- Not touched?
- No, I want you to be fair with them.

250
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,635
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?

251
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,756
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.

252
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,429
They do violence in their grandmothers'
neighbourhoods!

253
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,715
And everything with them is whores!
And junk, dope!

254
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,400
And they leave the gambling to last.

255
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,435
I want to run my family without you
on my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

256
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,233
<i>- No.
- Morte.</i>

257
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,316
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

258
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,273
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.

259
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,159
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

260
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,671
Your father did business with
Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,

261
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,792
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

262
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,196
or his Sicilian messenger boy,
Johnny Ola.

263
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,548
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

264
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,629
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!

265
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,798
Don Corleone.

266
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,831
Cicci, the door...

267
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,876
You want him to leave now?

268
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,638
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

269
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,154
The old man had too much wine.

270
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,390
It's late.

271
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,671
How's the baby?

272
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,998
- Sleeping inside me.
- Does it feel like a boy?

273
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,078
Yes, it does, Michael.

274
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,792
Kay?

275
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,277
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

276
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,595
It couldn't be helped, though.

277
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,792
It made me think
of what you once told me.

278
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,639
"In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate."

279
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,479
That was seven years ago.

280
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,510
I know. I'm trying, darling.

281
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,474
Did you see this?

282
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,551
Why are the drapes open?

283
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,952
Kay, are you all right?

284
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,594
- Are you hit?
- No.

285
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,939
It's all right.

286
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:37,998
It's all right.

287
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,675
Stop! Stop!

288
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,838
Halt!

289
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,995
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

290
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,111
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

291
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,673
Alive!

292
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,756
Stay by the door.

293
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,836
Yeah, come in.

294
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,353
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

295
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,193
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

296
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,111
And I know that's upset you in the past.

297
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,199
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

298
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,076
But it's because I admire you
and love you

299
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,839
that I kept things secret from you.

300
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,273
Now you're the only one I can trust.

301
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,792
Fredo?

302
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,354
Well, he's got a good heart.

303
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,837
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

304
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,717
Tom, you're my brother.

305
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,108
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

306
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,636
I know that.

307
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,431
You're going to take over.

308
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,596
You're going to be the Don.

309
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,673
If what I think has happened,
has happened, I'm leaving here tonight.

310
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,311
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

311
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,476
I'm trusting you
with the lives of my wife

312
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,478
and my children,
the future of this family.

313
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,476
- If we catch them, will we find out...
- We won't catch them.

314
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,757
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

315
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,312
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

316
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,832
Inside. Very, very frightened
that they botched it.

317
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,313
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?

318
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,878
See... All our people are businessmen.

319
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,358
Their loyalty is based on that.

320
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,000
One thing I learnt from Pop

321
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,790
was to try to think
as people around you think.

322
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,393
On that basis, anything is possible.

323
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,875
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!

324
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,072
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!

325
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,359
Over here! There's two of them.

326
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,519
Looks like they were hired
out of New York. I don't recognise them.

327
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,033
Won't get anything out of them now.

328
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,151
Fish them out.

329
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,750
Get rid of the bodies.

330
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,758
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

331
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,594
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.

332
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,437
- Did you like your party?
- I got lots of presents.

333
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,791
I know. Did you like them?

334
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,117
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

335
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,313
Well, they were friends.

336
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,312
- Did you see my present for you?
- It was on my pillow.

337
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,752
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

338
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,718
- Will you take me?
- No, I can't, Anthony.

339
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,516
- Why do you have to go?
- I have to do business.

340
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,158
I could help you.

341
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,438
I know. Some day you will.

342
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,671
Get some sleep.

343
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,952
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

344
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,832
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

345
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,589
I left Naples. I left Mama.

346
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,598
For a no-good tramp!

347
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,672
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

348
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,912
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

349
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,912
Without news from home.

350
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,471
Finally, a letter from Naples!

351
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,159
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

352
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,917
She's very beautiful.

353
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,190
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

354
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,639
Our dear mother...

355
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,831
...is dead!

356
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,913
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

357
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,077
Sit down, you bum!

358
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,477
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

359
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,230
We'll go see her backstage.

360
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,593
Who was that?

361
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,073
The Black Hand.

362
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,590
That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.

363
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,951
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

364
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,993
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

365
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,559
You'll pay me today!

366
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,078
Let's go.

367
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,271
Not my daughter! Let her go!

368
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,711
Here, take all my money!

369
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,915
Vito, come on.

370
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,237
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

371
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,077
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighbourhood pays him.

372
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,432
Even my father, in the grocery store.

373
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,879
If he's Italian...

374
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,189
...why does he bother other Italians?

375
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,595
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

376
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,752
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

377
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,678
If you're happy, I'm happy.

378
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,678
Don't you feel well?

379
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,352
Is your boss treating you all right?

380
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,958
Forget it.

381
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,193
Hey, you speak Italian?

382
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,999
Hide this for me!

383
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,556
Next week I'll come and get it!

384
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,836
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

385
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,551
How's business?

386
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,431
It's good, it's good.

387
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,072
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighbourhood's getting sloppy.

388
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,075
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

389
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,430
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

390
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,237
So Fanucci's changing?

391
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,950
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

392
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,991
Even from my father.

393
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,916
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

394
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,877
I've got some bad news.

395
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,396
I feel rotten about telling you this...

396
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,915
But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...

397
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,152
And you have to give him my job.

398
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,237
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

399
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,431
You looked after me like a father.

400
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,239
I thank you.

401
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,676
And I won't forget it.

402
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,397
Vito!

403
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,113
Oh, no!

404
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,431
Take this to your family.

405
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,915
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

406
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,558
What a nice pear!

407
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,508
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

408
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,431
Did you look inside?

409
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,628
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

410
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,639
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

411
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,756
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

412
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:35,076
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favour.

413
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,832
Yeah, sure.

414
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,837
My wife would like it.

415
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,635
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!

416
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,276
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

417
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,791
Well, he won't mind.

418
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,954
Come on in.

419
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,958
Hey, Vito, come on in!

420
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,957
This is your friend's place?

421
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,431
This is a real palace.

422
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,512
One of the best.

423
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,836
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

424
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,393
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

425
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,473
Come on in.

426
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,439
It's all right. Hyman's in there.

427
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:47,156
- Would you like a tuna sandwich?
- No, thank you.

428
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,790
<i>...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S. C...</i>

429
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,430
- Mr Roth?
- Come in, Michael.

430
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,794
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

431
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,556
It's almost over.

432
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:15,871
- Do you follow the football game?
- Not for a while I haven't.

433
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,398
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

434
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,355
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

435
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,394
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

436
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,075
I heard you had some trouble.

437
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,432
Stupid.

438
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,353
People behaving like that with guns.

439
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,039
The important thing is you're all right.

440
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,118
Good health is the most important thing.

441
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,838
More than success, more than money.

442
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,918
More than power.

443
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:18,309
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.

444
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,308
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.

445
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,353
Nobody wants another war.

446
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,998
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

447
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,749
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.

448
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,791
I'll visit him soon.

449
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,471
The important thing is that nothing
interferes with our plans for the future.

450
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,875
Nothing is more important.

451
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,549
- You're a wise and considerate man.
- And you're a great man, Mr Roth.

452
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,235
- There's much I can learn from you.
- Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

453
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,994
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Come in.

454
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,716
- Thank you, my dear.
- You're going to break your eardrums.

455
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,069
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

456
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,074
You're young, I'm old and sick.

457
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,948
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.

458
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,957
It's never been done before.

459
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:32,517
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

460
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,831
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

461
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,033
He's small potatoes.

462
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,669
What's up?

463
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,230
We got company?

464
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,754
What's going on?

465
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,831
Michael Corleone is here.

466
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,115
Where is he?

467
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,958
He's in your den. You better hurry.

468
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,551
He's been waiting a half hour.

469
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,556
Is something wrong?

470
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,156
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.

471
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,989
- I could have prepared something.
- I didn't want you to know.

472
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,389
- You heard what happened?
- I almost died. We were so relieved...

473
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,476
In my home!

474
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,192
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

475
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,035
Where my children come to play.

476
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,436
In my home.

477
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,793
I want you to help me take my revenge.

478
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,356
Michael, anything. What can I do?

479
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,432
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

480
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,074
I don't understand. I don't...

481
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,910
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

482
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:52,556
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-a-bitches.

483
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,231
- I know he is.
- So why ask me to lay down to them?

484
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,072
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

485
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,189
I know it was him.

486
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,236
Jesus Christ, Mike.

487
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,911
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.

488
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,519
This used to be my father's old study.

489
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,830
It's changed.

490
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,799
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.

491
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,829
I remember when I was a kid. We had
to be quiet when we played near here.

492
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,676
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

493
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,795
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

494
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,912
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

495
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:13,676
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer."

496
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:19,636
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
in this, in the Rosato brothers' favour,

497
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,036
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.

498
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,075
That's what I want him to think.

499
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,709
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.

500
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,194
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

501
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,876
<i>- Yeah?
- Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.</i>

502
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,269
<i>- We need some more help.
- Johnny?</i>

503
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,079
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

504
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,839
<i>- Who's that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.</i>

505
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,032
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.

506
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,437
<i>Pentangeli is going to accept
the Rosato brothers' deal.</i>

507
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,631
<i>- Oh, God.
- Will he come alone?</i>

508
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,798
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.

509
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,949
<i>Everything will be all right. Pentangeli
says he's willing to make a deal.</i>

510
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,312
<i>All we want to know is if he's on
the level, or if he'll bring his boys.</i>

511
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,478
You lied to me. I don't want you
to call me any more.

512
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:47,356
<i>- Your brother won't find out we talked.
- I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

513
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,155
- Who was that?
- Wrong number.

514
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:12,079
- Frankie, I've got nobody here.
- Wait in the car, Cicc'.

515
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,794
- Frankie.
- That's okay, Cicc'.

516
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:25,599
- What's this?
- A lucky C note for our new deal.

517
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,873
Ritchie. Give us a taste.

518
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,751
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

519
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,953
- You won't regret it.
- I don't like the C note, Rosato.

520
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,548
I take that as an insult.

521
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,558
Michael Corleone says hello!

522
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,275
Close the door!

523
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,311
Your friend the cop...

524
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,797
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

525
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,515
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

526
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,796
What's the matter?

527
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,832
- Is that something on the floor?
- Carmine, not here!

528
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,359
Anthony!

529
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,995
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!

530
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,189
Freddy, it's good to see you.

531
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,116
- How is he?
- He's okay. He's in the back.

532
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,029
Girls, take a hike.

533
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,996
In this room here.

534
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,110
- I want to talk to him alone first.
- Come on.

535
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,114
I thought I could help you, Senator.

536
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,558
Hagen?

537
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,679
- Listen, I did not...
- It's all right.

538
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,396
- I didn't do anything.
- It's okay. You're very lucky.

539
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,637
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

540
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,549
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.

541
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,591
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

542
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,712
- And I don't know how it happened.
- You can't remember?

543
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,876
I passed out.

544
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,318
Just a game. Jesus.

545
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,830
Jesus, Jesus!

546
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,270
Jesus God!

547
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,879
God!

548
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,236
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

549
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,397
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.

550
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:29,799
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.

551
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,351
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

552
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:39,792
- As his guest.
- I do remember that she was laughing.

553
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,233
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

554
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,959
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

555
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,913
It'll be as though she never existed.

556
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,033
All that's left is our friendship.

557
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,517
- Yes?
- Sorry, but we're not to let you through.

558
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,679
- I’m just going to the market.
- We'll pick up anything you want.

559
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,758
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr Hagen's. He's coming.

560
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,189
I'll speak to him.

561
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,156
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.

562
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:41,558
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.

563
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:46,674
- So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
- No, within the compound will be fine.

564
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,792
- We were going to New England.
- That's off.

565
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,393
- Am I a prisoner?
- That's not the way we look at it, Kay.

566
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,432
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

567
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,672
Joe.

568
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,278
Cuba, Cuba!

569
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,558
Most respected gentlemen.

570
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,716
Welcome to Havana.

571
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:37,755
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists

572
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,233
for continuing to work with Cuba

573
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,958
for the greatest period of prosperity

574
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,474
in her entire history.

575
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,831
Mr William Shaw,

576
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,599
representing
the General Fruit Company.

577
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,476
Messrs. Corngold and Dant,

578
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,158
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

579
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,879
Mr Petty,

580
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,709
Regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

581
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,279
Mr Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

582
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,315
Mr Michael Corleone of Nevada,

583
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,232
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

584
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,750
And my old friend and associate
from Florida,

585
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,078
Mr Hyman Roth.

586
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:34,309
I would like to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.

587
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,556
A solid gold telephone.

588
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,190
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.

589
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,718
- Mr President?
- Yes?

590
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:55,198
Could you discuss the rebel activity and
what this can mean to our businesses?

591
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:56,829
- Of course.
- Heavy stuff.

592
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:02,353
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las Villas,

593
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:14,312
my staff indicates, with assurance,
that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara

594
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,351
before the New Year.

595
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,997
I want to put you all at ease.

596
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,839
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

597
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,510
He said that they're making an arrest,

598
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,234
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

599
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,349
Johnny...

600
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,435
It's nothing.

601
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,760
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

602
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,079
<i>Viva Fidel!</i>

603
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:16,950
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

604
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,749
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

605
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,154
I'm very pleased

606
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:31,671
you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

607
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,873
When a man comes
to this point in his life,

608
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:40,517
he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

609
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,475
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had

610
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:51,754
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

611
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,440
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear!

612
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,473
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

613
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:04,510
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana

614
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,518
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

615
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:12,191
This kind of government knows
how to help business, to encourage it.

616
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,154
The hotels here are bigger
and swankier

617
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,510
than any of the joints in Vegas.

618
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,953
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government

619
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,596
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis

620
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,393
and has relaxed restrictions on imports.

621
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,718
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed...

622
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,513
Real partnership with a government.

623
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,437
Smaller piece.

624
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,910
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

625
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,555
At the time of my retirement, or death,

626
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:53,312
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.

627
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,069
But, all of you will share.

628
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,875
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

629
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,151
the Capri to the Corleone family,

630
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,555
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

631
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,116
but Eddie Levine will bring in the
Pennino brothers,

632
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,356
Dino and Eddie, for a piece

633
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,074
and to handle the casino operations.

634
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,476
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

635
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,115
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.

636
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:28,956
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

637
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,389
<i>- Happy birthday!
- L'chaim!</i>

638
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,194
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

639
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,517
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

640
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:43,838
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had in his jacket.

641
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,396
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.

642
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,115
- Those rebels are lunatics.
- Maybe so.

643
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,470
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.

644
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,149
- What does that tell you?
- They can win.

645
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,989
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.

646
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,669
I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.

647
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,395
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.

648
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,954
The trucks were owned by your father.

649
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,553
Michael.

650
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,359
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

651
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,872
The two million never got to the island.

652
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,312
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money

653
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,749
because you worried about the rebels.

654
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,437
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.

655
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:06,435
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

656
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,873
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.

657
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:18,759
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,

658
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,395
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.

659
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,476
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

660
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,916
90 miles. It's nothing.

661
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:37,551
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States

662
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,433
and having the cash
to make it possible.

663
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,273
Michael,

664
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,395
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

665
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,913
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

666
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:20,677
<i>- Hi! Freddy Corleone.
- Mio frati.</i>

667
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,837
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

668
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,397
I thought, "What if somebody knows
what I've got in here".

669
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:32,158
Can you imagine that? Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.

670
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,916
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

671
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,592
You want to count it?

672
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:49,348
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.

673
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,996
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.

674
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,310
That's great! Havana's great.

675
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,831
It's my kind of town.

676
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:07,631
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

677
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,954
No. I've never met them.

678
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,314
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

679
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:28,398
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?

680
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,554
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

681
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,636
I know a place where
we can spend some time together.

682
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:41,997
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.

683
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,759
Have kids. Have a family.

684
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:51,589
For once in my life, be more like

685
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,038
Pop.

686
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,632
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

687
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,832
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me."

688
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,316
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

689
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,431
Sometimes I think it's true.

690
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,356
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

691
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:17,309
Mikey, I was mad at you.

692
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,150
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

693
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,749
You want a drink, right? Waiter!

694
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,791
<i>Por favour...</i>

695
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,879
- How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
- Banana Daiquiri.

696
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,230
- That's it?
- That's it.

697
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,316
<i>Uno Banana Daiquiri</i>

698
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,474
and a club soda.

699
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,594
Senator Geary flies in from Washington
tomorrow

700
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,075
with some government people.

701
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,670
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.

702
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:10,433
- That's my speciality, right?
- Can I trust you with something?

703
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,469
Of course, Mike.

704
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,229
Later in the evening we're all invited
to the Presidential Palace

705
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,952
to bring in the New Year.

706
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:26,918
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car, alone.

707
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,678
For my protection.

708
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:33,070
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

709
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,159
- Who?
- Roth.

710
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,559
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

711
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,630
It was Roth all along.

712
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,469
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.

713
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,552
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.

714
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:22,671
- How can I help?
- Just go along, as if you know nothing.

715
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,360
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

716
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,920
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.

717
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:49,434
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.

718
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,755
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.

719
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,235
I don't trust a doctor
who can't speak English.

720
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,439
<i>- Gracias, señor.
- Buenas noches.</i>

721
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,710
- Honey, go to the casino.
- If you're feeling better.

722
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,478
Feel fine.

723
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:11,239
- Play the bingo game.
- Okay. Nice to see you, Mr Paul.

724
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:18,435
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

725
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:27,109
- You're pulling out?
- Just want to... Just want to wait.

726
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:33,950
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

727
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:37,550
I'd give four million to be able to take
a painless piss.

728
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:43,632
- Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
- The Rosato brothers.

729
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,832
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?

730
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,279
I know I didn't.

731
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:01,795
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

732
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:08,155
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.

733
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:11,875
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.

734
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:17,477
During prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

735
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,552
Made a fortune. Your father, too.

736
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:27,917
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.

737
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:36,232
Later on he had an idea to build a city

738
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,955
out of a desert stop-over
for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast.

739
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:45,315
That kid's name was Moe Greene

740
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,910
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.

741
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,675
This was a great man.

742
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,075
A man of vision and guts.

743
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:01,150
And there isn't even a plaque,
signpost or statue of him in that town.

744
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,556
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

745
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,955
No one knows who gave the order.

746
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,111
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

747
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:19,837
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

748
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:24,556
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.

749
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,352
And I said to myself,

750
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:33,234
"This is the business we've chosen."

751
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,476
I didn't ask

752
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:40,989
who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

753
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:53,478
That two million in a bag in your room...

754
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:59,150
I'm going in to take a nap.

755
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:04,874
When I wake, if the money
is on the table, I know I have a partner.

756
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:08,392
If it isn't, I know I don't.

757
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:05,193
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.

758
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,392
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.

759
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:11,273
Senator Payton from Florida...

760
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,632
Judge DeMalco from New York...

761
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,513
Senator Ream from Maryland...

762
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:20,035
Fred Corngold from UTT.

763
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,914
- That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
- He does?

764
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,190
Gentlemen, it's refill time!

765
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,598
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...

766
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:34,395
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas.

767
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,193
<i>- That you got! Con gusto...
- Johnny!</i>

768
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,750
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

769
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:45,350
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

770
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,909
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

771
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,633
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

772
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,593
<i>- Feliz Año Nuevo!
- Happy New Year.</i>

773
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:08,753
- Hey, Freddy, why are we standing?
- Everybody stands.

774
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:13,351
- It's worth it. You won't believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

775
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:16,392
- 50 dollars, right?
- You've got a bet, mister.

776
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,679
That's Superman.

777
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,476
Did I tell you or did I tell you?

778
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,594
- I don't believe it!
- It's got to be fake.

779
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,951
It's real. That's why
he's called Superman.

780
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,314
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?

781
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:16,638
Johnny Ola brought me here. I didn't
believe it, but seeing is believing!

782
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,036
- I see it, but still don't believe it!
- 50 bucks, Pat.

783
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,550
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!

784
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:29,190
- Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
- I want to see him break a brick!

785
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,037
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.

786
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,469
...and you'll continue to get those.

787
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:44,878
I don't believe that President
Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba

788
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,470
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.

789
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,997
The American public
believe in non-intervention...

790
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,873
Fredo! Where are you going?

791
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,470
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...

792
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,190
What kept Mr Roth?
I understood he was coming.

793
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,630
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?

794
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:07,716
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just
long enough to bring in the New Year.

795
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,711
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

796
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:41,599
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.

797
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,268
Don't make a big thing about it.

798
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:51,189
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

799
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,352
You broke my heart!

800
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:37,272
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

801
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,395
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

802
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:46,679
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

803
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,432
And I shall leave the city immediately.

804
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:57,353
I wish all of you good luck.

805
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:07,358
<i>Salud!</i>

806
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,791
<i>Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!</i>

807
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,193
Fredo!

808
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:38,634
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

809
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,071
Roth is dead.

810
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:45,873
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.

811
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,399
Fredo!

812
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:14,713
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

813
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,351
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!

814
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:28,436
Al. Get me a wet towel.

815
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:37,399
Does Kay know I'm back?

816
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:44,272
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?

817
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:47,631
- I took care of it.
- What was it, so I'll know.

818
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:52,630
It was a little car with an electric motor
that he can ride in. It's nice.

819
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:57,076
Thank you, Al.

820
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:01,510
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?

821
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,558
Where's my brother?

822
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,517
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

823
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:28,156
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.

824
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,998
I asked about Fredo.

825
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,231
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

826
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:38,434
All right.

827
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,353
I want you to get in touch with him.

828
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,153
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

829
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:50,354
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they would try to kill me.

830
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:55,353
- They can come in now.
- There was something else.

831
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,759
What?

832
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,152
What? Come on.

833
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,275
Kay had a miscarriage.

834
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,995
- Was it a boy?
- At three and a half months...

835
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:29,113
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?

836
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,274
I really don't know.

837
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,753
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

838
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:38,869
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

839
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:42,789
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

840
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,317
You know I've got three daughters.

841
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,398
This is my neighbourhood.

842
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:51,437
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

843
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:56,109
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

844
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,836
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

845
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,792
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

846
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:12,030
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

847
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,595
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

848
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,429
And your family will be ruined.

849
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:25,668
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

850
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:30,148
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

851
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,278
Now don't refuse me.

852
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:35,798
Understand, paisan?

853
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,399
I understand.

854
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:50,191
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

855
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:55,678
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

856
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,916
Don't be afraid to tell them!

857
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:05,918
600 bucks...

858
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,390
Suppose we don't pay?

859
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:12,791
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

860
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,797
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighbourhood.

861
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:21,030
<i>He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.</i>

862
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:23,557
$200 each... everybody agreed?

863
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,359
Why do we have to pay him?

864
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,110
Vito, leave this to us.

865
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,029
He's one person, we're three.

866
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,874
He's got guns, we've got guns.

867
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:42,591
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

868
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,950
<i>This is his neighbourhood!</i>

869
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:50,952
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

870
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,913
Who?

871
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:57,068
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.

872
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,599
They don't pay Fanucci.

873
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:05,036
<i>If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!</i>

874
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,988
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

875
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,599
Now what I say stays in this room.

876
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:32,476
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

877
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,677
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

878
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,435
If Fanucci says $200...

879
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:44,879
<i>...he means it, Vito!</i>

880
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:48,158
I'll reason with him.

881
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,117
Leave everything to me.

882
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,711
I'll take care of everything.

883
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:58,794
I never lie to my friends.

884
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,359
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

885
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,438
He'll ask for the money.

886
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:11,077
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

887
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:14,160
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

888
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,914
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

889
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:22,154
How can you get him to take less?

890
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,591
That's my business.

891
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:28,431
Just remember that I did you a favour.

892
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,593
Is it a deal?

893
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,235
Yes.

894
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,430
His family's out of the house.

895
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,995
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

896
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:35,235
<i>Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.</i>

897
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:48,269
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

898
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:55,758
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

899
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:31,917
It looks like there's
$100 under my hat.

900
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,390
I was right.

901
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:48,478
Only $100...

902
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,876
I'm short of money right now.

903
01:52:55,720 --> 01:53:00,077
I've been out of work... so just
give me a little time.

904
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:03,030
You understand, don't you?

905
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,428
You've got balls, young man!

906
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:18,278
How come I never heard
of you before?

907
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,830
You've got a lot of guts.

908
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,478
I'll find you some work
for good money.

909
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:48,479
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

910
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,475
You've done well for yourself.

911
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,271
Enjoy the festa!

912
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,475
Oh, this is too violent for me!

913
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:23,153
What've you got there?

914
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:59,069
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

915
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,276
<i>Mr Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,</i>

916
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:22,710
<i>you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?</i>

917
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:24,673
<i>That's right.</i>

918
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:29,593
<i>But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organisation.</i>

919
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:36,115
<i>No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.</i>

920
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:38,875
<i>What was your position?</i>

921
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:42,877
<i>At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.</i>

922
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,753
<i>- What is that?
- A button, you know, Senator.</i>

923
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:48,155
<i>No, I don't know. Tell me.</i>

924
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:54,998
<i>When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?</i>

925
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:56,348
<i>Mr Questadt.</i>

926
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,996
<i>- You mean you kill people?
- What?</i>

927
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:03,989
<i>You kill people at
the behest of your superiors.</i>

928
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:09,073
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

929
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:14,228
<i>And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?</i>

930
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:17,352
<i>Yeah, Counsellor. Michael Corleone.</i>

931
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:21,109
<i>Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?</i>

932
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:23,831
<i>No, I never talked to him.</i>

933
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:27,714
<i>Mr Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?</i>

934
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:30,991
<i>- Do what?
- Could you expand on your answer?</i>

935
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:36,672
<i>I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?</i>

936
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:41,112
<i>Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.</i>

937
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:45,438
<i>Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!</i>

938
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:51,239
<i>You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.</i>

939
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:20,430
Tell me something, Ma.

940
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:27,870
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

941
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:35,998
He was being strong...

942
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:43,759
Strong for his family.

943
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:55,714
But by being strong for his family...

944
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:58,918
...could he...

945
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:02,034
...lose it?

946
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:09,040
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

947
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,952
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

948
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:19,155
<i>No, I meant... lose his family.</i>

949
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:24,870
But you can never lose your family.

950
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:35,758
Times are changing.

951
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:59,749
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

952
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:02,152
Take it as a gift.

953
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,959
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

954
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,673
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

955
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:33,916
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

956
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,357
She's in bad trouble.

957
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:42,868
Her neighbours complained to the
landlord about her dog.

958
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:46,396
He told her to get rid of the animal.

959
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,959
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

960
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:56,195
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

961
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,673
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

962
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:03,918
I'm so ashamed!

963
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:08,552
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

964
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:12,799
I'm sorry, but...

965
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:18,036
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

966
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,233
I can't move!

967
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,397
I want you to talk to him!

968
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,514
Tell him I want to stay here!

969
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:35,519
What's your landlord's name?

970
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,911
His name is Signor Roberto.

971
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:40,795
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

972
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:44,193
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

973
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,713
A real pig-sty, eh?

974
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:08,834
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

975
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:12,877
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

976
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:17,479
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

977
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:21,594
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighbourhood.

978
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,436
I already rented the place
to another family.

979
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:35,191
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

980
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:40,115
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

981
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:42,511
So let her stay.

982
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:44,119
Impossible.

983
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,228
Are you Sicilian?

984
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:48,238
No, I'm Calabrese.

985
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:52,037
<i>We're practically paisan,
do me this favour.</i>

986
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:55,154
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

987
02:10:56,160 --> 02:10:58,310
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

988
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,155
How much more a month?

989
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:03,269
Five bucks.

990
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,878
Here's six months increase in advance.

991
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:14,672
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

992
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:17,594
Come see me in another six months.

993
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,873
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

994
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:23,715
The dog stays.

995
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:31,311
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

996
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:35,554
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

997
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,598
Do me this favour.

998
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:42,436
I won't forget it.

999
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:46,397
Ask your friends in the
neighbourhood about me.

1000
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:50,034
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favour.

1001
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:58,437
What a character!

1002
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:10,790
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

1003
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:21,237
He's been asking all around
the neighbourhood about you.

1004
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:31,633
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

1005
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:34,830
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

1006
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:38,671
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

1007
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,753
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

1008
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:51,479
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

1009
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:58,672
<i>Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!</i>

1010
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:04,071
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

1011
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:13,998
Can I sit down?

1012
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:19,753
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

1013
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,633
The rent stays like before!

1014
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,233
I'll even lower it.

1015
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,194
I'll lower it $5.

1016
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:43,833
I'll lower it $10!

1017
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:52,036
Can I offer you some coffee?

1018
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:58,751
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

1019
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:06,315
You'll have to excuse me for now.

1020
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:13,516
I wish I could stay longer!

1021
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:21,510
Just call me and I'll be here!

1022
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:34,958
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1023
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:54,351
- Vito, what do you think?
- We'll make a big business!

1024
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:04,118
<i>- New York City.
- Would you speak up, please?</i>

1025
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,518
<i>New York City.</i>

1026
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:10,076
<i>- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.</i>

1027
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:13,670
<i>- Where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.</i>

1028
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:19,512
<i>Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?</i>

1029
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:26,190
<i>Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.</i>

1030
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:31,272
<i>Mr Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness'statement.</i>

1031
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:36,235
<i>For years many of my constituents
have been of Italian descent.</i>

1032
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:38,955
<i>I've come to know them well.</i>

1033
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:43,119
<i>They have honoured me
with their support and their friendship.</i>

1034
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:48,155
<i>I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are Italian-Americans.</i>

1035
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:54,155
<i>However, Mr Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings</i>

1036
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:58,353
<i>in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.</i>

1037
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:02,313
<i>Before I leave, I do want to say this,</i>

1038
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:06,513
<i>that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever</i>

1039
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:09,154
<i>a slur upon the great Italian people.</i>

1040
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:12,238
<i>I can state from my own knowledge
and experience</i>

1041
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:17,275
<i>that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,</i>

1042
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:20,710
<i>patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.</i>

1043
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:26,555
<i>It would be a shame, Mr Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples</i>

1044
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:28,796
<i>to give a bad name to the whole barrel.</i>

1045
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:34,278
<i>Because from the time of Christopher
Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi</i>

1046
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:36,356
<i>to the present day,</i>

1047
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:40,599
<i>Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation.</i>

1048
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:46,029
<i>They are the salt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.</i>

1049
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:55,549
<i>I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.</i>

1050
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:59,753
<i>Mr Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.</i>

1051
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:05,034
<i>We have testimony from
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.</i>

1052
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:10,272
<i>He stated that you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in the country.</i>

1053
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:12,550
<i>- Are you?
- No, I'm not.</i>

1054
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:15,752
<i>He testified that you are
personally responsible</i>

1055
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:19,668
<i>for the murder of a New York
police captain in 1947</i>

1056
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:23,190
<i>and with him a man
named Virgil Sollozzo.</i>

1057
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:25,755
<i>- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.</i>

1058
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:28,872
<i>Is it true that in the year 1950</i>

1059
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:34,120
<i>you devised the murder of the heads
of "the Five Families" in New York</i>

1060
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:37,630
<i>to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?</i>

1061
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:40,991
<i>- It's a complete falsehood.
- Mr Questadt.</i>

1062
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:45,557
<i>Is it true you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?</i>

1063
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:51,589
<i>No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hotels there, but very little.</i>

1064
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:58,199
<i>I also have stock in IBM and IT& T.</i>

1065
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:05,230
<i>Do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in New York State?</i>

1066
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:06,793
<i>No, I do not.</i>

1067
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:10,310
<i>Senator, my client
would like to read a statement.</i>

1068
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:15,719
<i>Mr Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.</i>

1069
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:21,472
<i>Sir, my client has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.</i>

1070
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:27,312
<i>He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement should be heard!</i>

1071
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:33,955
<i>No, I'll allow Mr Corleone to read
his statement. I'll put it in the record.</i>

1072
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:38,752
<i>In the hopes of clearing
my family name</i>

1073
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:42,555
<i>to give my children their share
of the American way of life</i>

1074
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:45,592
<i>without a blemish on their name
and background,</i>

1075
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:50,669
<i>I have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation.</i>

1076
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:57,279
<i>I consider it a great personal dishonour
to have to deny that I am a criminal.</i>

1077
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:01,477
<i>I wish to have the following noted
for the record...</i>

1078
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:05,514
<i>That I served my country faithfully
in World War Two</i>

1079
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:10,555
<i>and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defence of my country.</i>

1080
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:15,558
<i>That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.</i>

1081
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:19,514
<i>That no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy</i>

1082
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:24,270
<i>whether it is called Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name</i>

1083
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:26,595
<i>has ever been made public.</i>

1084
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:28,677
<i>I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment,</i>

1085
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:31,712
<i>although it's my right to do so.</i>

1086
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:39,873
<i>I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me</i>

1087
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:45,632
<i>and if they do not, I hope they will have
the decency to clear my name</i>

1088
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:49,196
<i>with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it.</i>

1089
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:55,839
<i>I'm sure we’re impressed. Particularly
with your love for our country.</i>

1090
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:58,634
<i>We'll be in recess
until 10:00 a.m. Monday</i>

1091
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:03,356
<i>when we will produce a witness who'll
corroborate the charges against you.</i>

1092
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:08,315
<i>At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for per jury.</i>

1093
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:12,672
<i>I remind you that you’re still
under subpoena. Adjourned!</i>

1094
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:19,232
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

1095
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:23,876
A ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose!

1096
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,437
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1097
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:32,836
- Well, just get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah.

1098
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:34,996
You've got a big day tomorrow.

1099
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:38,556
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

1100
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:42,357
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

1101
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:46,439
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1102
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:51,475
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1103
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:55,916
Come on! I saw this 19 times.

1104
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,595
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

1105
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,758
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1106
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:08,636
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1107
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:11,433
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

1108
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:14,199
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

1109
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:16,550
Some deal!

1110
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:22,755
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1111
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:29,508
- How did they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1112
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:32,630
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers

1113
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:34,671
they tried to kill him.

1114
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,916
He thought you double-crossed him.

1115
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:41,111
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared

1116
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:43,800
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

1117
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:48,079
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

1118
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:55,318
The FBI has him airtight.
He's on an army base, 24 hour guards.

1119
02:21:55,520 --> 02:22:00,196
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1120
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:05,433
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1121
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:08,996
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1122
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:13,273
Roth, he played this one beautifully.

1123
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:22,999
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1124
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:03,194
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1125
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:07,115
We have time.

1126
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:10,278
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1127
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:13,591
I didn't know all that much.

1128
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:19,156
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1129
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:21,876
Anything you can tell me now?

1130
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:26,274
They've got Pentangeli.

1131
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:43,915
I didn't know
it was going to be a hit, Mike.

1132
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:46,270
I swear to God I didn't know.

1133
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:53,118
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1134
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:57,798
He said that he wanted to talk.

1135
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:05,230
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1136
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:11,838
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1137
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:15,669
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations

1138
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:19,918
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast,

1139
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:23,869
it would be good for the family.

1140
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:29,678
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1141
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:33,759
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1142
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:37,793
- I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
- Taken care of me?

1143
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:41,759
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1144
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:46,639
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1145
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:51,679
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

1146
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:56,638
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."

1147
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:59,672
"Let Fredo fetch somebody
at the airport!"

1148
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:02,712
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

1149
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:06,469
- It's the way Pop wanted it.
- It's not the way I wanted it!

1150
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:11,956
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1151
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:15,835
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1152
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:28,155
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

1153
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:41,637
The Senate lawyer, Questadt.
He belongs to Roth.

1154
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,632
Fredo,

1155
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,508
you're nothing to me now.

1156
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:01,589
Not a brother, not a friend.

1157
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:06,238
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1158
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:10,193
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1159
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:12,709
I don't want you near my house.

1160
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:19,077
When you see our mother, I want
to know in advance, so I won't be there.

1161
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,198
You understand?

1162
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:33,431
Mikey.

1163
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:43,429
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1164
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:34,670
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1165
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:38,839
- Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
- Frankie Five-Angels...

1166
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:59,874
<i>This committee will come to order!</i>

1167
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:05,233
<i>- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.</i>

1168
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:08,875
<i>- Where were you born?
- Partinico, it's outside of Palermo.</i>

1169
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:10,991
<i>Where do you live now?</i>

1170
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:16,149
<i>I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.</i>

1171
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:21,478
<i>We have here a witness
that will further testify</i>

1172
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:27,675
<i>to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal
empire that controls all gambling.</i>

1173
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:32,630
<i>This witness has had no buffer
between himself and Michael Corleone.</i>

1174
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:35,797
<i>He can corroborate enough charges</i>

1175
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:40,357
<i>for us to recommend a charge
of per jury against Michael Corleone.</i>

1176
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:42,391
- Senator.
- Thank you, Chairman.

1177
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:45,239
<i>Mr Pentangeli.</i>

1178
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:51,793
<i>Mr Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?</i>

1179
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:56,790
<i>Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,</i>

1180
02:28:56,920 --> 02:29:01,232
<i>and under Vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?</i>

1181
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:09,228
<i>I never knew any Godfather.</i>

1182
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:13,711
<i>I have my own family.</i>

1183
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:19,429
<i>Mr Pentangeli, you...</i>

1184
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:23,792
<i>You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.</i>

1185
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,515
<i>I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...</i>

1186
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:31,679
<i>were you at any time a member of
a crime organisation</i>

1187
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:33,552
<i>led by Michael Corleone?</i>

1188
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:36,513
I don't know nothing about that!

1189
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:43,228
I was in the olive oil business
with his father

1190
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:45,828
but that was a long time ago.

1191
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:49,792
<i>We have a sworn affidavit.</i>

1192
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:55,956
<i>Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.</i>

1193
02:29:56,080 --> 02:30:00,358
<i>Do you deny this confession, and do
you realise what will happen if you do?</i>

1194
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:03,472
<i>The FBI guys promised me a deal</i>

1195
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:09,033
<i>so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.</i>

1196
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:13,028
<i>But it was all lies. Everything!</i>

1197
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:15,870
<i>They kept saying,</i>

1198
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:20,870
<i>"Michael Corleone did this"
and "Michael Corleone did that".</i>

1199
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:25,988
<i>So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"</i>

1200
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:32,116
<i>Mr Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentleman sitting to your left?</i>

1201
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:34,310
I can answer that.

1202
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:36,750
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1203
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:41,878
<i>- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.</i>

1204
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:46,631
<i>- Will he come forward and be sworn?
- He doesn't understand English.</i>

1205
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:49,718
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

1206
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:54,075
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

1207
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:57,829
<i>- He knows nothing about this?
- To my knowledge, nothing.</i>

1208
02:30:57,960 --> 02:31:02,556
<i>I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.</i>

1209
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:04,636
<i>- The witness is excused.
- Senator!</i>

1210
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:09,190
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1211
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:13,508
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1212
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:43,868
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hello, darling.

1213
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:47,596
The children are outside. We're going.

1214
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:51,434
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

1215
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:54,589
Rocco?

1216
02:31:55,640 --> 02:31:58,074
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1217
02:32:00,760 --> 02:32:03,672
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1218
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:07,076
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1219
02:32:10,040 --> 02:32:12,474
I'm very happy for you.

1220
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:16,958
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

1221
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:22,751
- Why don't you sit down?
- No, I'm not going to stay long.

1222
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:26,475
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1223
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:31,470
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1224
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:34,592
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

1225
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:40,231
- I wasn't going to say anything...
- What do you mean, "too late"?

1226
02:32:45,400 --> 02:32:47,914
What really happened with Pentangeli?

1227
02:32:53,560 --> 02:32:58,475
- His brother came and helped him.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.

1228
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:00,398
Where is he now?

1229
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:04,234
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1230
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:07,275
All he had to do was show his face.

1231
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:13,516
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1232
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:24,789
I don't want you going!
Not you, not the kids. No.

1233
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:29,668
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.

1234
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:34,589
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

1235
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:38,315
Things between men and women
will not change.

1236
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:42,229
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

1237
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:47,355
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

1238
02:33:47,560 --> 02:33:50,597
- Anthony is not fine!
- I don't want to hear about it.

1239
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:54,509
- Anthony is...
- I don't want to hear about it!

1240
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:57,756
Over!

1241
02:34:09,320 --> 02:34:12,710
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1242
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:18,595
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

1243
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:34,356
Kay...

1244
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:39,156
We're leaving tomorrow.

1245
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:42,872
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1246
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:48,518
- Michael, you haven't heard me.
- Kay, what do you want from me?

1247
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:54,915
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

1248
02:34:55,720 --> 02:35:01,033
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1249
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:04,835
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

1250
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:07,910
Don't you know that?

1251
02:35:09,560 --> 02:35:11,357
Kay...

1252
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:18,551
In time, you'll feel differently.

1253
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:22,878
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1254
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:26,597
I know that.

1255
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:31,836
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1256
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:34,595
Yes.

1257
02:35:35,880 --> 02:35:38,440
I know what that meant to you.

1258
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:42,431
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1259
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:46,039
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1260
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:49,111
I'm going to change.

1261
02:35:50,520 --> 02:35:54,513
I'll change. I've learnt that I have
the strength to change.

1262
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:59,438
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage

1263
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:04,950
and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.

1264
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:10,239
- We'll go on.
- Oh, Michael!

1265
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:13,590
Michael, you are blind.

1266
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:17,595
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1267
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:20,999
It was an abortion.

1268
02:36:22,840 --> 02:36:27,789
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1269
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:31,996
Something that's unholy and evil!

1270
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:35,755
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1271
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:40,275
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1272
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:44,469
It was an abortion, Michael.

1273
02:36:44,600 --> 02:36:49,993
It was a son and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1274
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:55,439
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

1275
02:36:56,800 --> 02:37:01,920
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1276
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:06,511
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1277
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:16,873
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

1278
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:21,118
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

1279
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:50,670
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1280
02:40:59,960 --> 02:41:01,871
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1281
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:08,518
Allow me the honour of
introducing someone.

1282
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:11,553
My partner in America, in New York.

1283
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:13,958
His name is Vito Corleone.

1284
02:41:14,680 --> 02:41:17,069
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1285
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:19,239
To his company in America.

1286
02:41:23,880 --> 02:41:26,997
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

1287
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:41,718
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

1288
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:45,553
Where is this young man
from New York?

1289
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:51,758
Have him come closer.

1290
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:55,479
I can't see him so good.

1291
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:05,710
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1292
02:42:08,120 --> 02:42:09,712
Bless you!

1293
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:13,039
What's your name?

1294
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:21,272
You took the name of this town!

1295
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:23,478
And what's your father's name?

1296
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:27,110
His name was... Antonio Andolini.

1297
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:30,990
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1298
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:37,392
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1299
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:40,280
...and this is for you!

1300
02:43:58,880 --> 02:44:01,348
Michael, say goodbye.

1301
02:45:02,040 --> 02:45:03,359
Hi, Al.

1302
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,833
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1303
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:27,072
Tom, where's Mike?

1304
02:45:28,280 --> 02:45:30,236
Waiting for you to leave.

1305
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:37,038
- Can I talk with him?
- Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1306
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:40,797
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

1307
02:45:53,400 --> 02:45:55,630
Michael, it's Connie.

1308
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:17,513
Michael...

1309
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:23,756
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1310
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,116
Is Kay coming?

1311
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:38,078
No.

1312
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:48,599
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1313
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:52,429
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1314
02:46:55,960 --> 02:46:57,712
That's right.

1315
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:03,677
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1316
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:09,350
Please, I want to talk to you.

1317
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:24,314
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

1318
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:29,834
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know

1319
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:34,956
that I could hurt you.

1320
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:44,998
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

1321
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:47,392
And I forgive you.

1322
02:47:51,920 --> 02:47:53,751
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1323
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:59,191
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1324
02:48:05,320 --> 02:48:08,949
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

1325
02:48:18,440 --> 02:48:19,873
Connie.

1326
02:49:57,960 --> 02:50:00,394
Tom, sit down.

1327
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:15,235
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1328
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:20,991
- Did you hear about it?
- I hear that he's in Israel.

1329
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:25,957
The High Court in Israel
turned down his request to live there.

1330
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:29,596
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

1331
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:32,314
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1332
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:36,315
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1333
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:41,108
- They turned him down.
- He's going to try Panama.

1334
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:45,677
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

1335
02:50:46,120 --> 02:50:50,557
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

1336
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:53,593
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1337
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:57,759
- That plane goes to Miami.
- That's right. That's where I want it met.

1338
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:03,994
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.

1339
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:07,272
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1340
02:51:07,400 --> 02:51:08,753
It would be
like trying to kill the President.

1341
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:13,112
- There's no way we can get to him!
- Tom, you surprise me.

1342
02:51:15,880 --> 02:51:19,316
If anything in this life is certain,

1343
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:22,477
if history has taught us anything,

1344
02:51:22,600 --> 02:51:25,034
it's that you can kill anyone.

1345
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:34,876
- Rocco?
- Difficult. Not impossible.

1346
02:51:35,240 --> 02:51:36,832
Good.

1347
02:51:39,240 --> 02:51:42,676
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1348
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:51,837
I thought you were going to tell me that
you were moving your family to Vegas

1349
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:56,875
and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

1350
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:03,556
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

1351
02:52:07,640 --> 02:52:10,279
- Let's do business.
- All right.

1352
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:14,998
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1353
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:18,236
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.

1354
02:52:18,360 --> 02:52:20,749
Are they worth it,
are they strong enough?

1355
02:52:21,240 --> 02:52:25,916
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

1356
02:52:26,040 --> 02:52:31,068
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

1357
02:52:38,520 --> 02:52:41,080
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

1358
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:48,319
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress

1359
02:52:48,520 --> 02:52:51,478
and move them all to Las Vegas.

1360
02:52:54,480 --> 02:52:59,270
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?

1361
02:53:03,720 --> 02:53:05,278
So... you're staying?

1362
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:09,475
Yes, I'm staying.

1363
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:13,991
What do you want me to do?

1364
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:16,431
Hey, Anthony.

1365
02:53:16,960 --> 02:53:21,397
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1366
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:23,829
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

1367
02:53:24,040 --> 02:53:26,508
You know, when I was your age,

1368
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:33,593
I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1369
02:53:34,760 --> 02:53:38,070
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1370
02:53:38,920 --> 02:53:42,913
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

1371
02:53:44,520 --> 02:53:48,069
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1372
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:51,716
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1373
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:58,079
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1374
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:03,709
- Do you want to try it out on the lake?
- Okay.

1375
02:54:05,480 --> 02:54:06,549
What else have you got?

1376
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:34,634
Everything will be okay.

1377
02:54:34,840 --> 02:54:38,549
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah, don't worry.

1378
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:43,436
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1379
02:54:44,480 --> 02:54:47,631
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

1380
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:52,515
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1381
02:54:52,720 --> 02:54:56,349
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1382
02:55:01,440 --> 02:55:03,237
Tom,

1383
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:06,394
what do I do now?

1384
02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:08,997
Frankie.

1385
02:55:13,400 --> 02:55:17,234
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1386
02:55:18,680 --> 02:55:21,956
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1387
02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:25,596
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1388
02:55:28,080 --> 02:55:33,598
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organisation of the families,

1389
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:38,874
basing them on the old Roman legions,
with "regimes," "capos" and "soldiers".

1390
02:55:40,120 --> 02:55:43,954
- And it worked.
- Yeah, it worked.

1391
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:48,030
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1392
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:51,232
We was like the Roman Empire.

1393
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:54,636
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1394
02:55:56,960 --> 02:55:58,791
Yeah,

1395
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,230
it was once.

1396
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:06,953
Frankie.

1397
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:20,396
When a plot
against the Emperor failed

1398
02:56:21,640 --> 02:56:24,916
the plotters were always
given a chance

1399
02:56:26,840 --> 02:56:30,230
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

1400
02:56:30,360 --> 02:56:32,396
Only the rich guys.

1401
02:56:32,520 --> 02:56:37,230
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

1402
02:56:37,440 --> 02:56:42,389
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

1403
02:56:43,560 --> 02:56:47,633
And their families were taken care of.

1404
02:56:49,240 --> 02:56:52,437
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1405
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:54,519
Yeah.

1406
02:56:55,400 --> 02:56:57,391
They went home

1407
02:56:58,560 --> 02:57:01,393
and sat in a hot bath

1408
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:03,955
opened up their veins

1409
02:57:04,160 --> 02:57:06,720
and bled to death.

1410
02:57:07,880 --> 02:57:11,839
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1411
02:57:16,840 --> 02:57:20,435
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1412
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:23,791
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1413
02:57:41,520 --> 02:57:44,478
<i>- See you, Tom.
- Addio, Frankie.</i>

1414
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:57,952
Kay. You have to go.

1415
02:57:59,720 --> 02:58:02,871
- So pretty...
- Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1416
02:58:11,360 --> 02:58:14,989
Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye.

1417
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:20,159
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

1418
02:58:20,360 --> 02:58:25,195
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony. I love you, Anthony.

1419
02:58:26,320 --> 02:58:28,595
Kay, please.

1420
02:58:31,400 --> 02:58:33,231
All right.

1421
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,230
Mary, come here.

1422
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:56,633
Anthony.

1423
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:59,593
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1424
03:00:34,720 --> 03:00:36,711
Easy.

1425
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:45,112
Anthony! Anthony!

1426
03:00:45,280 --> 03:00:48,158
- He's here, we're going fishing.
- No!

1427
03:00:48,360 --> 03:00:51,511
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1428
03:00:51,640 --> 03:00:53,517
Shit!

1429
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:57,996
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1430
03:00:58,960 --> 03:01:02,714
- I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

1431
03:01:06,240 --> 03:01:07,719
Hey, Anthony.

1432
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:11,958
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

1433
03:01:15,880 --> 03:01:17,154
Let's go.

1434
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:58,719
- Mr Roth, I must take you into custody.
- I understand.

1435
03:01:58,920 --> 03:02:01,878
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?

1436
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:04,719
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1437
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:09,550
I went to Israel to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

1438
03:02:15,680 --> 03:02:19,116
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1439
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:28,592
Frankie!

1440
03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:46,599
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

1441
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:50,236
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

1442
03:02:50,440 --> 03:02:53,796
I came home to vote
in the presidential election

1443
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:57,231
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1444
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:11,395
Jesus Christ.

1445
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:16,831
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1446
03:03:18,320 --> 03:03:20,754
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1447
03:03:21,560 --> 03:03:24,518
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1448
03:03:25,720 --> 03:03:29,713
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1449
03:04:09,920 --> 03:04:14,835
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1450
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:18,240
- You know my brother Fredo.
- Sure.

1451
03:04:18,440 --> 03:04:22,991
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1452
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:26,237
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.

1453
03:04:26,360 --> 03:04:29,079
Say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, isn't he?

1454
03:04:29,200 --> 03:04:30,633
Yes.

1455
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:34,674
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

1456
03:04:35,200 --> 03:04:38,829
Sit down. Talk to each other.

1457
03:04:39,040 --> 03:04:41,156
Hey, Mr Einstein...

1458
03:04:44,400 --> 03:04:46,755
- The cake.
- Sally, get in here!

1459
03:04:46,960 --> 03:04:48,951
- I was scared.
- Come on.

1460
03:04:49,640 --> 03:04:52,791
- Where's your father?
- Christmas shopping.

1461
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,230
Let's see that thing.

1462
03:04:56,920 --> 03:04:58,717
That's nice!

1463
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:02,515
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

1464
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:06,558
- What is that? Rum?
- Yeah.

1465
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:14,517
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

1466
03:05:14,720 --> 03:05:17,234
He's not ugly...

1467
03:05:22,560 --> 03:05:28,476
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

1468
03:05:28,600 --> 03:05:31,876
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

1469
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,514
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

1470
03:05:34,720 --> 03:05:38,998
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

1471
03:05:39,200 --> 03:05:42,636
- 30,000 enlisted this morning.
- Bunch of saps...

1472
03:05:42,840 --> 03:05:46,150
- Why are they saps?
- Let's not talk about the war.

1473
03:05:47,280 --> 03:05:48,998
You talk to Carlo.

1474
03:05:50,920 --> 03:05:54,356
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.

1475
03:05:54,480 --> 03:05:57,756
- That's Pop talking.
- You're right, that's Pop talking!

1476
03:05:57,880 --> 03:06:01,509
- They risk their lives for their country.
- Country isn't your blood.

1477
03:06:01,640 --> 03:06:07,272
- I don't feel that way.
- Then quit college and join the army!

1478
03:06:07,400 --> 03:06:08,753
I did.

1479
03:06:09,720 --> 03:06:12,518
I've enlisted in the Marines.

1480
03:06:14,720 --> 03:06:17,792
- Why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

1481
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:21,913
- Pop managed to get you a deferment.
- I didn't ask for it.

1482
03:06:22,680 --> 03:06:24,636
I didn't want it.

1483
03:06:25,800 --> 03:06:28,109
Come on! Knock it off!

1484
03:06:28,320 --> 03:06:31,835
- Punk!
- Sonny, sit down.

1485
03:06:34,720 --> 03:06:38,030
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1486
03:06:41,080 --> 03:06:43,640
Go and show Carlo the tree.

1487
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:55,113
Nice.

1488
03:06:56,920 --> 03:06:58,353
Nice.

1489
03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:01,520
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1490
03:07:02,600 --> 03:07:05,239
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

1491
03:07:05,360 --> 03:07:07,351
Don't encourage him!

1492
03:07:07,480 --> 03:07:10,040
Get me a drink. Go on!

1493
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:17,070
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1494
03:07:17,280 --> 03:07:21,239
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

1495
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:26,669
You've talked to my father
about my future?

1496
03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:32,038
- My future.
- Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

1497
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:34,797
- I have my own plans for my future.
- Did you go to college to get stupid?

1498
03:07:34,832 --> 03:07:37,435
- I have my own plans for my future.
- Did you go to college to get stupid?

1499
03:07:37,560 --> 03:07:39,357
He's here!

1500
03:07:41,240 --> 03:07:43,071
Come on.

1501
03:07:45,280 --> 03:07:47,111
Stupid!

1502
03:08:03,720 --> 03:08:05,950
Surprise!

1503
03:08:08,960 --> 03:08:14,353
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1504
03:08:14,480 --> 03:08:18,075
<i>That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...</i>
