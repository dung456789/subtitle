1
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:07,116
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:11,662
the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,002
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:22,673
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:27,678
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:31,599
- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,977
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:38,522
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,192
If they say so.

10
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:44,236
I really don't remember. I was upset.

11
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:46,947
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,867
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:54,205
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:58,959
Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:02,296
whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.

16
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:05,800
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,220
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:13,808
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:15,893
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:17,603
and waited.

21
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,480
With what intention?

22
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,524
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:25,569
I was confused... drunk.

24
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:30,574
I think... mostly I
wanted to scare them.

25
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:34,119
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

26
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:36,413
No, I was sobering up.

27
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:40,292
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

28
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:43,462
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

29
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:45,756
I've been very clear on this point.

30
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:49,969
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

31
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:52,763
and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

32
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:55,099
riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

33
00:03:56,434 --> 00:04:00,646
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

34
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:02,565
Yes, it does.

35
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,943
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

36
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,195
before the murders took place.

37
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:10,614
That's very convenient.

38
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:12,491
It's the truth.

39
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:17,454
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

40
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:21,750
so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

41
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,379
taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

42
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,465
And that also...

43
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:32,344
is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,764
Since I am innocent of this crime...

45
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:40,644
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

46
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,832
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.

47
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:05,878
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

48
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:08,964
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

49
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:12,134
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

50
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:13,886
And most of all...

51
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:17,181
we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

52
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,391
lying dead in each other's arms.

53
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,187
They had sinned.

54
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:26,941
But was their crime so great...

55
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,401
as to merit a death sentence?

56
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:31,904
While you think about that...

57
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,157
think about this:

58
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:39,745
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

59
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:43,666
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

60
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,669
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

61
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:47,878
No.

62
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:50,047
This was revenge...

63
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:53,884
of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

64
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,470
Four bullets per victim.

65
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:58,931
Not six shots fired, but eight.

66
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:03,060
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

67
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,063
and then stopped to reload...

68
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:08,899
so that he could shoot
each of them again.

69
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:11,694
An extra bullet per lover...

70
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:14,238
right in the head.

71
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:22,538
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

72
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:25,082
It chills my blood just to look at you.

73
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,753
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

74
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:34,258
I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

75
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:37,136
one for each of your victims. So be it!

76
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,454
Sit.

77
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,794
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

78
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:14,965
- Yes, sir.
- You feel you've been rehabilitated?

79
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,968
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

80
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:21,096
I mean, I learned my lesson.

81
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,601
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

82
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:31,190
I'm no longer a danger to society.

83
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,358
That's God's honest truth.

84
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:10,979
Hey, Red.

85
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,481
How'd it go?

86
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,858
Same old shit, different day.

87
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,985
Yeah, I know how you feel.

88
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:19,196
I'm up for rejection next week.

89
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,491
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

90
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,992
It happens.

91
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:25,619
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

92
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:29,123
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

93
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:30,332
- Four!
- Five!

94
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,878
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

95
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,880
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

96
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,217
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

97
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:43,846
a bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

98
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:46,181
Damn near anything within reason.

99
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:50,102
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

100
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,983
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

101
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:59,736
and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

102
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:02,239
I told him, "No problem."

103
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,929
Officers to main gate.
Officers to main gate.

104
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,141
Secure main gate.

105
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:46,283
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

106
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:50,370
in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

107
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:54,791
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

108
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,002
Good work for a man so young.

109
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:03,884
Hey, Red.

110
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,005
You speak English, butt-steak?

111
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:44,091
You follow this officer.

112
00:10:56,854 --> 00:11:01,108
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

113
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,944
Hey, fish! Come over here!

114
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:28,593
Taking bets today, Red?

115
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,679
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

116
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,556
Smokes. Put me down for two.

117
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:34,683
All right, who's your horse?

118
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,643
That little sack of shit.

119
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:41,523
- Eighth. He'll be first.
- Bullshit! I'll take that action.

120
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:43,942
You're out some smokes, son.

121
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,902
If you're so smart, you call it.

122
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:49,197
I'll take the chubby fat-ass there.

123
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:51,992
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

124
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:56,913
Fresh fish today!

125
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:59,124
We're reeling them in!

126
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,462
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

127
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,923
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

128
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,384
That was my first impression of the man.

129
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:11,011
What do you say?

130
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,514
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

131
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:16,850
That guy? Never happen.

132
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,311
- Ten cigarettes.
- That's a rich bet.

133
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,605
Who's going to prove me wrong?

134
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,607
Heywood? Jigger?

135
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,192
Skeets?

136
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:26,735
Floyd!

137
00:12:27,653 --> 00:12:29,738
Four brave souls.

138
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:32,699
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

139
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:36,203
All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.

140
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,766
Turn to the right!

141
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,226
Eyes front.

142
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,908
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

143
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:17,202
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

144
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,621
You are convicted felons.

145
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:21,915
That's why they've sent you to me.

146
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,875
Rule number one:

147
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:25,585
No blasphemy.

148
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:29,506
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

149
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:30,924
The other rules...

150
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:34,428
you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

151
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:35,846
When do we eat?

152
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,565
You eat when we say you eat.

153
00:13:46,774 --> 00:13:50,026
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

154
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:53,071
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

155
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:56,324
On your feet.

156
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,285
I believe in two things:

157
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:00,954
Discipline and the Bible.

158
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:03,540
Here, you'll receive both.

159
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,460
Put your trust in the Lord.

160
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:09,296
Your ass belongs to me.

161
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:13,049
Welcome to Shawshank.

162
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:19,556
Unhook them.

163
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,396
Turn around.

164
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:34,654
That's enough.

165
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:37,574
Move to the end of the cage.

166
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:41,077
Turn around. Delouse him.

167
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:44,498
Turn around.

168
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:50,045
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

169
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:51,588
Next man up!

170
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:56,593
To the right. Right. Right.

171
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:58,386
Left.

172
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:02,599
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

173
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:06,144
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

174
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:10,148
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

175
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:13,235
And when they put you in that cell...

176
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:15,779
and those bars slam home...

177
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,448
that's when you know it's for real.

178
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:22,035
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

179
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:26,623
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

180
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,127
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

181
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:34,381
Somebody always breaks down crying.

182
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:36,550
Happens every time.

183
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,261
The only question is...

184
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,221
who's it going to be?

185
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,559
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

186
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:49,312
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

187
00:15:58,322 --> 00:15:59,990
Lights out!

188
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,846
I remember my first night.

189
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:26,600
Seems like a long time ago.

190
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:31,438
Hey, fish.

191
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,274
Fish, fish.

192
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,611
What are you, scared of the dark?

193
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:42,657
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

194
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:46,286
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.

195
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,461
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Keep it down.

196
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:57,881
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

197
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:01,134
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

198
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:04,137
Hey, Fat Ass.

199
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,973
Fat Ass!

200
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:09,893
Talk to me, boy.

201
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:13,271
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

202
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:16,441
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

203
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:18,568
This place ain't so bad.

204
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:20,236
Tell you what...

205
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:24,574
I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

206
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:28,161
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

207
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:30,330
love to make your acquaintance.

208
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:34,042
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

209
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:35,335
God!

210
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:37,420
I don't belong here!

211
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:40,423
- We have a winner!
- I want to go home!

212
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:43,385
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

213
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,891
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

214
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:52,268
I don't belong here.

215
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:55,855
I want to go home!

216
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,066
I want my mother!

217
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,443
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

218
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,866
What the Christ is this horseshit?

219
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:09,160
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

220
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,588
You'll tell him with
my baton up your ass!

221
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,789
You gotta let me out!

222
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:16,418
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

223
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:19,629
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

224
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,172
Not me!

225
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:23,717
I won't count to three. Not even to one.

226
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:25,969
You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

227
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,180
- Shut up, man. Shut up!
- There's been a mistake.

228
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:32,600
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

229
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,102
Open that cell.

230
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:37,564
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

231
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:47,073
Son of a bitch!

232
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,330
Captain, take it easy!

233
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:19,981
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

234
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,610
I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

235
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:26,446
Every last motherfucker in here.

236
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:33,536
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

237
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:52,514
His first night in the joint,
Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

238
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:55,725
He never made a sound.

239
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,409
Tier 3 north, clear count!

240
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:16,371
- Tier 2 north, clear.
- Tier 2 south, clear.

241
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,998
Tier 3 south, clear.

242
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:23,253
- Tier 1 south, clear.
- Tier 4 south, clear.

243
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:25,421
Prepare to roll out.

244
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,510
Roll out!

245
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,608
Are you going to eat that?

246
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:29,527
I hadn't planned on it.

247
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:31,821
Do you mind?

248
00:21:40,414 --> 00:21:41,831
That's nice and ripe.

249
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:55,637
Jake says thank you.

250
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:59,307
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

251
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:04,103
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

252
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:07,023
Oh, no! Here he comes.

253
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,819
Morning, fellas.

254
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,988
Fine morning, isn't it?

255
00:22:14,323 --> 00:22:16,532
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

256
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:19,035
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

257
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:21,871
just like a pretty little
chorus line.

258
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:24,207
Look at that.

259
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,877
- I can't stand this guy.
- Oh, Lord!

260
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:31,047
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

261
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:32,590
Smell my ass!

262
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,801
After he smells mine.

263
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:38,930
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

264
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:41,975
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

265
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:45,186
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

266
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:49,565
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

267
00:22:49,858 --> 00:22:51,401
Hey, Tyrell.

268
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:53,736
You pull infirmary duty this week?

269
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:56,280
How's my horse doing anyway?

270
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:57,824
Dead.

271
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:00,868
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

272
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:03,246
Doc had gone home for the night.

273
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:06,040
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

274
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,710
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

275
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:16,300
What was his name?

276
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,930
What'd you say?

277
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,268
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

278
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:28,688
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

279
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,817
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

280
00:23:54,882 --> 00:23:56,883
Anybody come at you yet?

281
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:00,845
Anybody get to you yet?

282
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:05,058
Hey, we all need friends in here.

283
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,018
I could be a friend to you.

284
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:17,653
Hard to get.

285
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,240
I like that.

286
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:31,417
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

287
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:33,711
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

288
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:37,006
trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

289
00:24:37,716 --> 00:24:40,927
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

290
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:43,513
to say more than two words
to somebody.

291
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:46,265
As it turned out...

292
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:48,601
that somebody was me.

293
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,153
I'm Andy Dufresne.

294
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:02,115
Wife-killing banker.

295
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:05,701
Why'd you do it?

296
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,204
I didn't, since you ask.

297
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:10,623
You're going to fit right in.

298
00:25:10,874 --> 00:25:13,543
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

299
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:17,380
- What you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

300
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,969
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

301
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:26,764
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

302
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:28,432
What do you think?

303
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,894
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

304
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,815
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

305
00:25:36,775 --> 00:25:40,069
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

306
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,864
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

307
00:25:43,574 --> 00:25:44,866
A rock hammer.

308
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:47,910
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

309
00:25:49,246 --> 00:25:51,956
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

310
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,584
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

311
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,587
Fair enough.

312
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:00,631
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

313
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:03,176
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

314
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:04,594
For rocks.

315
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:08,431
Quartz?

316
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,813
And some mica, shale...

317
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:18,316
limestone.

318
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:19,692
So?

319
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:22,445
So I'm a rock hound.

320
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:25,990
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

321
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:29,410
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

322
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:32,455
No, I have no enemies here.

323
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:34,957
No? Wait a while.

324
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:38,169
Word gets around.

325
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:41,339
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

326
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:44,508
Especially Bogs.

327
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,971
Don't suppose it would help if I
told them I'm not homosexual.

328
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:50,598
Neither are they.

329
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:54,268
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

330
00:26:58,774 --> 00:27:03,152
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

331
00:27:03,362 --> 00:27:06,906
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

332
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:09,867
- Thanks for the advice.
- Well, that's free.

333
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:12,161
You understand my concern.

334
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:14,997
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

335
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:19,961
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

336
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:22,505
What did I miss? What's so funny?

337
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:25,633
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

338
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:29,679
What's an item like this usually go for?

339
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:32,390
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

340
00:27:32,891 --> 00:27:35,351
My normal markup's 20 percent.

341
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,937
But this is a specialty item.

342
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:42,608
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

343
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:44,151
Ten it is.

344
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:47,905
Waste of money, if you ask me.

345
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:49,490
Why's that?

346
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,911
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

347
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,498
They find it, you're going to lose it.

348
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,792
If they catch you, you don't know me.

349
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:02,211
Mention my name,
we never do business again.

350
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:05,840
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

351
00:28:06,675 --> 00:28:08,217
I understand.

352
00:28:09,428 --> 00:28:12,763
Thank you, Mr... Red.

353
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:14,807
Name's Red.

354
00:28:16,226 --> 00:28:17,893
Why do they call you that?

355
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:23,649
Maybe it's because I'm lrish.

356
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:34,702
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

357
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:37,997
He had a quiet way about him...

358
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:42,501
a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

359
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:44,295
He strolled...

360
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:48,716
like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

361
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:53,596
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

362
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:57,767
I think it would be fair to say...

363
00:28:58,018 --> 00:29:00,269
I liked Andy from the start.

364
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:05,608
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

365
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,447
Move it! Come on, move it!

366
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:16,952
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

367
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:30,591
Keep it moving.

368
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:35,638
Red.

369
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:56,575
Andy was right.

370
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:59,036
I finally got the joke.

371
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:01,747
It would take a man about 600 years...

372
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:04,417
to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

373
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:10,631
- Book?
- Not today.

374
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,681
- Book?
- No.

375
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:27,189
Delivery for Dufresne.

376
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:39,493
Book?

377
00:30:42,664 --> 00:30:46,459
Dufresne, here's your book.

378
00:30:51,465 --> 00:30:52,715
Thanks.

379
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:02,683
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

380
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:41,555
This will blind you.

381
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:44,308
Honey, hush.

382
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:58,822
That's it. You fight!

383
00:31:59,032 --> 00:32:00,491
Better that way.

384
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,835
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

385
00:32:12,045 --> 00:32:14,046
and the Sisters let him be.

386
00:32:14,631 --> 00:32:16,465
I wish I could tell you that...

387
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:19,635
but prison is no fairy-tale world.

388
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:22,721
He never said who did it.

389
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:24,557
But we all knew.

390
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:31,897
Things went on like that for a while.

391
00:32:32,315 --> 00:32:34,817
Prison life consists of routine...

392
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:37,027
and then more routine.

393
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:43,075
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

394
00:32:44,536 --> 00:32:46,370
The Sisters kept at him.

395
00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:48,664
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

396
00:32:48,873 --> 00:32:50,374
Sometimes not.

397
00:32:51,543 --> 00:32:53,711
And that's how it went for Andy.

398
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:56,046
That was his routine.

399
00:32:56,881 --> 00:33:00,342
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

400
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:04,179
And I also believe
if things had gone on that way...

401
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,974
this place would have
got the best of him.

402
00:33:07,726 --> 00:33:10,519
But then, in the spring of 1949...

403
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:12,646
the powers that be decided:

404
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:16,191
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

405
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,570
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

406
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,739
As you know...

407
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,035
special detail carries with it
special privileges.

408
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:28,662
It was outdoor detail...

409
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,334
and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

410
00:33:33,793 --> 00:33:34,877
Stay in line there.

411
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:38,255
More than 100 men
volunteered for the job.

412
00:33:42,552 --> 00:33:45,554
Wallace E. Unger.

413
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:48,390
Ellis Redding.

414
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,184
Wouldn't you know it?

415
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:53,896
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

416
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:56,106
Andrew Dufresne.

417
00:33:56,524 --> 00:33:59,443
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

418
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:02,404
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

419
00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:06,075
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

420
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:07,868
I say, "Yeah?"

421
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,747
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

422
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:15,876
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

423
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:18,253
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

424
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:20,756
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

425
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:25,094
"He died a rich man." Oil wells and shit.
Close to a million bucks.

426
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:27,638
A million bucks?

427
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:32,434
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
- You going to see any of that?

428
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:35,813
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

429
00:34:36,022 --> 00:34:37,773
- Dollars?
- Yep.

430
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:40,943
That's great!
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

431
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:42,444
Isn't it?

432
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:45,572
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

433
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:48,117
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

434
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,244
Poor Byron.

435
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:54,289
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

436
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:56,792
Some people really got it awful.

437
00:34:57,043 --> 00:34:58,419
Andy, are you nuts?

438
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:00,504
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

439
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:03,674
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

440
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:06,677
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

441
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:09,054
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

442
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:13,016
maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

443
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:16,937
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

444
00:35:17,147 --> 00:35:19,273
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

445
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:23,485
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

446
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:28,323
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

447
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:31,076
Some brother. Shit!

448
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,416
Mr. Hadley...

449
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:39,668
do you trust your wife?

450
00:35:41,296 --> 00:35:42,755
Oh, that's funny.

451
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:45,966
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

452
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:49,470
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

453
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:54,016
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

454
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:55,309
He'll push him off!

455
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:57,352
If you trust her, you can keep...

456
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,937
that 35,000.

457
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:02,858
- What did you say?
- Thirty-five thousand.

458
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:04,026
All of it.

459
00:36:04,235 --> 00:36:07,321
- Every penny.
- You better start making sense.

460
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,865
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

461
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:13,952
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

462
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:16,538
- Bullshit. Tax-free?
- Tax-free.

463
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:18,707
IRS can't touch one cent.

464
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:21,543
You're that smart banker
what killed his wife.

465
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:25,172
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

466
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:28,217
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

467
00:36:28,384 --> 00:36:32,471
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

468
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,350
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

469
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,937
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

470
00:36:40,146 --> 00:36:41,730
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

471
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:44,191
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

472
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:48,111
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

473
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:50,405
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

474
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:52,366
nearly free of charge.

475
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:56,912
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

476
00:36:57,872 --> 00:36:59,414
"Coworkers." That's rich!

477
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,751
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

478
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:06,421
if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

479
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:07,881
sir.

480
00:37:11,803 --> 00:37:13,762
What are you jimmies staring at?

481
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,556
Let's go! Work!

482
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:26,984
And that's how it came to pass...

483
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:29,862
that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

484
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:34,616
the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

485
00:37:34,826 --> 00:37:37,953
wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

486
00:37:38,162 --> 00:37:43,625
drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

487
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:47,129
that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

488
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:49,756
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

489
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:55,429
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

490
00:37:56,556 --> 00:38:01,018
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

491
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:04,813
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

492
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:07,858
We were the lords of all creation.

493
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:10,027
As for Andy...

494
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:12,905
he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

495
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:15,616
a strange little smile on his face...

496
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:18,035
watching us drink his beer.

497
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:27,502
Want a cold one?

498
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:31,131
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

499
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:38,180
You could argue he'd done it
to curry favor with the guards.

500
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,684
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

501
00:38:43,394 --> 00:38:44,478
Me?

502
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:47,481
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

503
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:50,150
if only for a short while.

504
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:53,862
King me.

505
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,367
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
- What?

506
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:00,327
Civilized. Strategic.

507
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:03,997
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

508
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:06,041
Let me teach you someday.

509
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:08,543
Sure.

510
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:10,754
We could get a board together.

511
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:14,049
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

512
00:39:14,258 --> 00:39:18,261
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

513
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:21,765
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

514
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:23,767
I think it'll take years.

515
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:26,520
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

516
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:28,689
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

517
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:30,732
Pebbles, mostly.

518
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:37,864
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

519
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:40,283
Yeah, I guess.

520
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,452
Can I ask you something?

521
00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:45,372
Why'd you do it?

522
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:48,166
I'm innocent, Red.

523
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:50,419
Just like everybody else here.

524
00:39:54,757 --> 00:39:56,299
What are you in for?

525
00:39:59,012 --> 00:40:01,179
Murder. Same as you.

526
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:02,556
Innocent?

527
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:07,644
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

528
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:08,497
Where's the canary?

529
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:09,998
How did you know?

530
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,501
- How did I know what?
- So you don't know.

531
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:13,835
Come.

532
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,465
This is where the canary is.

533
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:24,471
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

534
00:41:27,975 --> 00:41:29,351
That's quite a...

535
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:31,978
surprise.

536
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:37,692
Wait, wait.

537
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:39,694
Here she comes.

538
00:41:39,987 --> 00:41:42,864
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

539
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:45,784
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

540
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:47,869
Gilda, are you decent?

541
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:50,038
Me?

542
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,501
God, I love it.

543
00:41:59,674 --> 00:42:02,676
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

544
00:42:03,678 --> 00:42:07,389
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

545
00:42:07,598 --> 00:42:09,724
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

546
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:11,685
Can you get her?

547
00:42:13,062 --> 00:42:16,439
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

548
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:19,985
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

549
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:24,573
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

550
00:42:25,158 --> 00:42:26,491
But I'll get her.

551
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:28,034
Relax.

552
00:42:29,912 --> 00:42:31,204
Thanks.

553
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:53,560
- Take a walk!
- I got to change reels!

554
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:55,770
I said fuck off!

555
00:43:01,944 --> 00:43:03,278
Ain't you going to scream?

556
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:06,489
Let's get this over with.

557
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:13,622
He broke my fucking nose!

558
00:43:22,924 --> 00:43:24,132
Now...

559
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:26,801
I'm going to open my fly...

560
00:43:27,053 --> 00:43:29,804
and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

561
00:43:30,973 --> 00:43:33,558
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

562
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:35,894
He ought to have
something to show for it.

563
00:43:36,103 --> 00:43:37,979
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

564
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:40,774
No, you don't understand.

565
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:44,152
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

566
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,822
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

567
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,950
causes the victim to bite down hard.

568
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,662
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

569
00:43:54,455 --> 00:43:56,915
they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

570
00:43:57,124 --> 00:43:58,500
with a crowbar.

571
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:03,004
Where do you get this shit?

572
00:44:03,172 --> 00:44:04,589
I read it.

573
00:44:06,008 --> 00:44:08,677
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

574
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:11,638
Honey.

575
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:15,100
You shouldn't!

576
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,689
Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.

577
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,024
And neither did his friends.

578
00:44:23,442 --> 00:44:27,279
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

579
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:30,448
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

580
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:33,785
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

581
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:39,374
Time's up, Bogs.

582
00:44:43,212 --> 00:44:44,879
It's your world, boss.

583
00:44:48,134 --> 00:44:50,927
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

584
00:44:51,137 --> 00:44:53,805
All prisoners report for lockdown.

585
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:09,738
What?

586
00:45:22,418 --> 00:45:24,919
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

587
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:32,010
No! No! Help me!

588
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:38,266
Two things never happened again
after that.

589
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:41,686
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

590
00:45:42,521 --> 00:45:45,023
And Bogs never walked again.

591
00:45:46,192 --> 00:45:49,694
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

592
00:45:49,904 --> 00:45:52,405
To my knowledge,
he lived out the rest of his days...

593
00:45:52,573 --> 00:45:54,699
drinking his food through a straw.

594
00:45:55,701 --> 00:45:59,788
Andy could use a nice "welcome back"
when he gets out of the infirmary.

595
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,124
Sounds good to us.

596
00:46:03,376 --> 00:46:05,877
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

597
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:08,880
The man likes to play chess.

598
00:46:09,382 --> 00:46:11,299
Let's get him some rocks.

599
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,166
Guys!

600
00:46:45,918 --> 00:46:47,001
I got one.

601
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:48,670
I got one. Look!

602
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:54,676
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

603
00:46:54,844 --> 00:46:56,761
What are you, a fucking geologist?

604
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:58,680
He's right. It ain't.

605
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:01,808
- What the hell is it then?
- It's a horse apple.

606
00:47:02,768 --> 00:47:05,186
- Bullshit!
- No, horseshit.

607
00:47:05,354 --> 00:47:06,855
Petrified.

608
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:14,362
Oh, Jesus.

609
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:17,031
Damn!

610
00:47:17,366 --> 00:47:21,578
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

611
00:47:21,787 --> 00:47:23,788
And by the weekend
he was due back...

612
00:47:23,998 --> 00:47:27,709
we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

613
00:47:28,544 --> 00:47:31,045
Also got a big shipment in that week.

614
00:47:31,297 --> 00:47:33,673
Cigarettes... chewing gum...

615
00:47:33,883 --> 00:47:35,341
sipping whisky...

616
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:38,928
playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

617
00:47:39,138 --> 00:47:41,890
And, of course, the most important item:

618
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:45,810
Rita Hayworth herself.

619
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,722
- Okay, look alive!
- Open all tiers.

620
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:25,183
Heads up. They're tossing cells.

621
00:48:25,392 --> 00:48:28,102
Heads up. They're tossing cells!

622
00:48:29,688 --> 00:48:31,189
119.

623
00:48:33,025 --> 00:48:34,692
123.

624
00:48:44,954 --> 00:48:45,954
On your feet.

625
00:48:48,624 --> 00:48:50,124
Face the wall.

626
00:49:24,243 --> 00:49:26,160
Turn around and face the warden.

627
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:34,836
Pleased to see you reading this.

628
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:38,089
Any favorite passages?

629
00:49:38,966 --> 00:49:41,342
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

630
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,761
when the master
of the house cometh."

631
00:49:44,888 --> 00:49:47,056
Mark 13:35.

632
00:49:47,808 --> 00:49:49,684
I've always liked that one.

633
00:49:50,603 --> 00:49:52,270
But I prefer:

634
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,606
"I am the light of the world.

635
00:49:55,065 --> 00:49:58,359
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

636
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:01,195
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

637
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:03,531
I hear you're good with numbers.

638
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:04,699
How nice.

639
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,869
Man should have a skill.

640
00:50:10,414 --> 00:50:11,456
Explain this.

641
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:16,711
It's called a rock blanket.
For shaping and polishing rocks.

642
00:50:17,129 --> 00:50:19,047
A little hobby of mine.

643
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:31,351
It's pretty clean.

644
00:50:31,602 --> 00:50:34,729
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

645
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:41,069
I can't say I approve of this.

646
00:50:42,696 --> 00:50:44,155
But I suppose...

647
00:50:46,241 --> 00:50:48,242
exceptions can be made.

648
00:50:58,587 --> 00:50:59,921
Lock them up!

649
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:04,425
I almost forgot.

650
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:07,011
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

651
00:51:07,763 --> 00:51:09,681
Salvation lies within.

652
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,932
Yes, sir.

653
00:51:19,483 --> 00:51:22,068
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

654
00:51:22,528 --> 00:51:26,447
Truth is... Norton
wanted to size Andy up.

655
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:42,463
My wife made that in church group.

656
00:51:45,134 --> 00:51:46,426
Very nice, sir.

657
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,470
You enjoy working the laundry?

658
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,807
No, sir. Not especially.

659
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:55,601
Perhaps we can find something more...

660
00:51:55,853 --> 00:51:58,312
befitting a man of your education.

661
00:52:06,363 --> 00:52:07,864
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

662
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,493
I thought I heard you out here.

663
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:14,704
I've been reassigned to you.

664
00:52:14,997 --> 00:52:17,331
I know, they told me.

665
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:20,209
Ain't that a kick in the head?

666
00:52:20,419 --> 00:52:22,712
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

667
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,088
Come on.

668
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:27,216
Well, here she is.

669
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:29,427
The Shawshank Prison Library.

670
00:52:30,095 --> 00:52:32,096
National Geographics...

671
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:35,808
Reader's Digest condensed books...

672
00:52:36,018 --> 00:52:37,602
and Louis L'Amour.

673
00:52:38,187 --> 00:52:40,021
Look magazine.

674
00:52:40,355 --> 00:52:42,690
Erle Stanley Gardners.

675
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:46,402
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

676
00:52:46,612 --> 00:52:49,280
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

677
00:52:49,782 --> 00:52:52,533
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

678
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:56,162
- Any questions?
- How long have you been librarian?

679
00:52:57,372 --> 00:53:01,375
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

680
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:04,879
And have you ever had an assistant?

681
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:07,548
No. Not much to it, really.

682
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,550
Why me? Why now?

683
00:53:09,968 --> 00:53:11,260
I don't know.

684
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,514
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

685
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:28,069
That's him. That's the one.

686
00:53:35,702 --> 00:53:36,869
I'm Dekins.

687
00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:38,913
I was...

688
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:43,417
thinking about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

689
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:48,798
I see.

690
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:56,889
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

691
00:54:00,102 --> 00:54:03,062
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

692
00:54:14,408 --> 00:54:15,700
Thanks.

693
00:54:16,368 --> 00:54:17,451
So...

694
00:54:19,204 --> 00:54:20,955
Mr. Dekins...

695
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,875
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins..."

696
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:27,086
do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

697
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:28,337
He didn't say that!

698
00:54:28,672 --> 00:54:31,173
As God as my witness!

699
00:54:31,466 --> 00:54:33,175
Dekins blinked for a second...

700
00:54:33,385 --> 00:54:36,512
then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

701
00:54:36,972 --> 00:54:39,307
- My ass!
- Shook his hand.

702
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:42,351
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

703
00:54:42,561 --> 00:54:46,814
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

704
00:54:47,024 --> 00:54:49,650
he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

705
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:51,485
Making a few friends?

706
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:54,447
I wouldn't say "friends."

707
00:54:54,656 --> 00:54:58,492
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

708
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,995
It's a wonderful pet to have.

709
00:55:01,204 --> 00:55:02,997
Got you out of the laundry, though.

710
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,458
It might do more than that.

711
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:08,377
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

712
00:55:08,587 --> 00:55:11,172
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

713
00:55:12,883 --> 00:55:15,885
How do you expect to do that? I mean...

714
00:55:16,094 --> 00:55:19,055
get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

715
00:55:19,514 --> 00:55:21,599
I'll ask the warden for funds.

716
00:55:22,476 --> 00:55:26,729
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

717
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,357
one immutable, universal truth:

718
00:55:29,524 --> 00:55:31,817
Not one of them born whose asshole...

719
00:55:31,985 --> 00:55:36,030
wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

720
00:55:36,907 --> 00:55:39,825
- The budget's stretched thin as it is.
- I see.

721
00:55:40,035 --> 00:55:43,454
Perhaps I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

722
00:55:43,664 --> 00:55:47,750
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

723
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,378
More walls, more bars, more guards.

724
00:55:50,587 --> 00:55:53,255
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

725
00:55:53,465 --> 00:55:56,217
- They can't ignore me forever.
- Sure can.

726
00:55:56,468 --> 00:55:59,136
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

727
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:02,056
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

728
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:06,519
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

729
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:08,312
just like he said.

730
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:15,111
And, just like Norton said...

731
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,779
Andy got no answers.

732
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:29,917
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

733
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:33,504
Year after that, he did them all...

734
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:35,673
including the warden's.

735
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:40,886
Year after that,
they rescheduled the intramural season...

736
00:56:41,096 --> 00:56:43,514
to coincide with tax season.

737
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,562
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

738
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:51,105
So Moresby Prison...

739
00:56:51,273 --> 00:56:53,566
issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

740
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:55,484
Right. The holster too.

741
00:56:55,694 --> 00:56:58,154
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

742
00:56:58,363 --> 00:57:01,407
Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

743
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:06,620
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

744
00:57:06,872 --> 00:57:09,331
Could you hand me
a stack of 1040s?

745
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:14,378
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

746
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,799
And still, he kept sending those letters.

747
00:57:25,557 --> 00:57:26,599
It's Brooks.

748
00:57:27,726 --> 00:57:29,226
Watch the door.

749
00:57:29,478 --> 00:57:30,811
Please, Brooks.

750
00:57:30,979 --> 00:57:32,855
- Calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

751
00:57:33,315 --> 00:57:35,941
- Stay back, goddamn it!
- What's going on?

752
00:57:36,151 --> 00:57:38,694
One second he's fine,
then out come the knife.

753
00:57:38,904 --> 00:57:40,696
We can talk about this, right?

754
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:44,700
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

755
00:57:44,993 --> 00:57:46,702
What's he done to you?

756
00:57:46,912 --> 00:57:48,579
It's what they done!

757
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:50,331
I got no choice.

758
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:53,125
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

759
00:57:53,335 --> 00:57:55,795
- Right, Heywood?
- Sure. I know that.

760
00:57:56,004 --> 00:57:59,340
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

761
00:57:59,508 --> 00:58:00,716
Right, guys?

762
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:04,178
So put the knife down.
Brooks, look at me.

763
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:06,680
Put the knife down.

764
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,684
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

765
00:58:11,436 --> 00:58:13,771
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

766
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:16,148
It's the only...

767
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:18,400
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

768
00:58:18,693 --> 00:58:21,028
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

769
00:58:21,279 --> 00:58:23,364
Put it... Put it down.

770
00:58:32,124 --> 00:58:33,624
Take it easy.

771
00:58:34,292 --> 00:58:35,876
You'll be all right.

772
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:38,504
Him? What about me?

773
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:41,090
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

774
00:58:41,299 --> 00:58:43,217
You've had worse from shaving.

775
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:45,511
What did you do to set him off?

776
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,930
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

777
00:58:48,557 --> 00:58:51,225
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

778
00:58:53,395 --> 00:58:56,355
I just don't understand
what happened in there, that's all.

779
00:58:56,523 --> 00:58:59,358
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

780
00:58:59,568 --> 00:59:01,443
That's enough out of you.

781
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:04,405
- Heard he had you shitting your pants.
- Fuck you.

782
00:59:04,656 --> 00:59:05,865
Knock it off.

783
00:59:06,825 --> 00:59:08,242
Brooks ain't no bug.

784
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,873
He's just institutionalized.

785
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,168
"Institutionalized," my ass.

786
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:21,380
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

787
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,299
This is all he knows.

788
00:59:23,508 --> 00:59:25,801
In here, he's an important man...

789
00:59:26,011 --> 00:59:27,094
an educated man.

790
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:29,847
Outside, he's nothing.

791
00:59:30,724 --> 00:59:34,226
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

792
00:59:34,436 --> 00:59:37,438
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

793
00:59:37,689 --> 00:59:39,440
You know what I'm trying to say?

794
00:59:39,691 --> 00:59:42,610
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

795
00:59:43,862 --> 00:59:46,113
You believe whatever you want.

796
00:59:46,698 --> 00:59:49,116
But I tell you these walls are funny.

797
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:52,369
First you hate them.

798
00:59:54,206 --> 00:59:56,123
Then you get used to them.

799
00:59:58,043 --> 01:00:00,044
Enough time passes...

800
01:00:00,712 --> 01:00:02,713
you get so you depend on them.

801
01:00:03,715 --> 01:00:05,925
That's "institutionalized."

802
01:00:06,134 --> 01:00:07,426
Shit.

803
01:00:07,636 --> 01:00:10,387
- I could never get like that.
- Oh, yeah?

804
01:00:11,264 --> 01:00:13,766
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

805
01:00:13,975 --> 01:00:15,559
Goddamn right.

806
01:00:18,146 --> 01:00:20,064
They send you here for life...

807
01:00:20,732 --> 01:00:23,067
that's exactly what they take.

808
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:26,820
Part that counts, anyway.

809
01:00:34,412 --> 01:00:37,331
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

810
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,167
You go on now.

811
01:00:41,419 --> 01:00:45,756
You're free.

812
01:01:04,776 --> 01:01:06,443
Good luck, Brooksie.

813
01:01:08,738 --> 01:01:10,823
Take care of yourself, Brooks.

814
01:01:44,399 --> 01:01:45,899
Dear fellas:

815
01:01:46,192 --> 01:01:50,404
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

816
01:01:51,698 --> 01:01:54,366
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

817
01:01:55,577 --> 01:01:59,079
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

818
01:01:59,748 --> 01:02:02,166
but now they're everywhere.

819
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:10,132
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

820
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:29,735
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

821
01:02:30,028 --> 01:02:33,072
called "The Brewer"...
and a job...

822
01:02:33,281 --> 01:02:36,241
bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

823
01:02:37,786 --> 01:02:40,204
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

824
01:02:40,413 --> 01:02:42,790
but my hands hurt most of the time.

825
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:45,042
Make sure your man double-bags.

826
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:47,294
Last time, the bottom near came out.

827
01:02:47,962 --> 01:02:50,881
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

828
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:52,466
Yes, sir. Surely will.

829
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:56,178
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

830
01:02:59,182 --> 01:03:03,477
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

831
01:03:03,937 --> 01:03:05,437
I keep thinking...

832
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:08,982
Jake might just show up
and say hello.

833
01:03:09,609 --> 01:03:11,610
But he never does.

834
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:17,658
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

835
01:03:21,287 --> 01:03:23,997
I have trouble sleeping at night.

836
01:03:24,332 --> 01:03:27,584
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

837
01:03:27,836 --> 01:03:30,087
I wake up scared.

838
01:03:30,296 --> 01:03:34,508
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

839
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:40,931
Maybe I should get me a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

840
01:03:41,224 --> 01:03:45,561
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

841
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:51,233
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

842
01:03:51,484 --> 01:03:53,193
I don't like it here.

843
01:03:53,403 --> 01:03:57,406
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

844
01:03:58,241 --> 01:03:59,908
not to stay.

845
01:04:10,837 --> 01:04:13,380
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

846
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:17,092
not for an old crook like me.

847
01:05:19,572 --> 01:05:23,825
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me."

848
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:28,705
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

849
01:05:28,915 --> 01:05:31,250
"No hard feelings. Brooks."

850
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:43,679
He should have died in here.

851
01:05:49,227 --> 01:05:50,644
What the fuck have you done?

852
01:05:50,812 --> 01:05:53,480
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

853
01:05:59,028 --> 01:06:02,781
- What's all this?
- You tell me. They're addressed to you.

854
01:06:04,033 --> 01:06:05,367
Take it.

855
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:15,419
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:"

856
01:06:16,546 --> 01:06:18,505
In response to your repeated inquiries...

857
01:06:18,715 --> 01:06:23,010
"...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

858
01:06:23,761 --> 01:06:25,596
This is $200.

859
01:06:25,805 --> 01:06:29,808
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded..."

860
01:06:30,018 --> 01:06:32,561
with a donation of used books
and sundries.

861
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,898
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

862
01:06:37,108 --> 01:06:38,984
"Please stop sending us letters."

863
01:06:39,152 --> 01:06:41,820
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

864
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:43,196
Yes, sir.

865
01:06:47,493 --> 01:06:48,660
Good for you, Andy.

866
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:55,876
It only took six years.

867
01:06:57,462 --> 01:07:00,213
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

868
01:07:00,381 --> 01:07:03,717
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

869
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:06,428
like he said.
I've got to pinch a loaf.

870
01:07:06,638 --> 01:07:08,096
When I come back...

871
01:07:08,306 --> 01:07:10,057
this is all gone, all right?

872
01:07:58,815 --> 01:08:00,232
Do you hear that?

873
01:09:08,968 --> 01:09:10,135
Dufresne!

874
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,181
Andy, let me out!

875
01:09:21,063 --> 01:09:26,026
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

876
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,528
Truth is, I don't want to know.

877
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:31,239
Some things are best left unsaid.

878
01:09:34,827 --> 01:09:37,537
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

879
01:09:37,747 --> 01:09:39,873
it can't be expressed in words...

880
01:09:40,082 --> 01:09:43,001
and makes your heart ache
because of it.

881
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:47,172
I tell you, those voices soared...

882
01:09:47,423 --> 01:09:51,718
higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

883
01:09:51,928 --> 01:09:55,305
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

884
01:09:55,515 --> 01:09:58,266
and made those walls dissolve away.

885
01:09:58,726 --> 01:10:00,894
And for the briefest of moments...

886
01:10:01,103 --> 01:10:04,105
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

887
01:10:06,692 --> 01:10:09,361
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

888
01:10:10,655 --> 01:10:11,655
Open the door.

889
01:10:14,575 --> 01:10:16,326
Open it up!

890
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:20,372
Dufresne, open this door!

891
01:10:21,707 --> 01:10:22,916
Turn that off!

892
01:10:29,966 --> 01:10:32,425
I am warning you. Turn that off!

893
01:10:50,152 --> 01:10:51,695
You're mine now.

894
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,372
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

895
01:11:02,582 --> 01:11:04,165
On your feet.

896
01:11:05,334 --> 01:11:07,752
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

897
01:11:09,505 --> 01:11:13,174
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

898
01:11:13,509 --> 01:11:16,303
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

899
01:11:16,512 --> 01:11:19,639
- Was it worth two weeks?
- Easiest time I ever did.

900
01:11:19,849 --> 01:11:24,060
- No such thing as easy time in the hole.
- A week in the hole is like a year.

901
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:27,564
- Damn straight.
- I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

902
01:11:27,773 --> 01:11:30,734
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

903
01:11:33,154 --> 01:11:34,529
It was in here.

904
01:11:35,364 --> 01:11:36,615
In here.

905
01:11:37,742 --> 01:11:39,826
That's the beauty of music. They...

906
01:11:40,036 --> 01:11:42,370
can't get that from you.

907
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:48,293
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

908
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:53,214
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

909
01:11:54,258 --> 01:11:55,967
Lost interest in it, though.

910
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:57,761
Didn't make much sense in here.

911
01:11:58,095 --> 01:12:00,096
Here's where it makes the most sense.

912
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,682
You need it so you don't forget.

913
01:12:03,267 --> 01:12:04,559
Forget?

914
01:12:04,852 --> 01:12:09,564
Forget that there are...
places...

915
01:12:10,066 --> 01:12:13,902
in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

916
01:12:14,904 --> 01:12:16,404
There's something...

917
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:18,156
inside...

918
01:12:18,407 --> 01:12:20,367
that they can't get to...

919
01:12:20,576 --> 01:12:21,993
that they can't touch.

920
01:12:22,495 --> 01:12:23,912
That's yours.

921
01:12:25,456 --> 01:12:27,040
What are you talking about?

922
01:12:28,084 --> 01:12:31,711
Hope.

923
01:12:33,673 --> 01:12:35,674
Let me tell you something, my friend.

924
01:12:36,467 --> 01:12:38,760
Hope is a dangerous thing.

925
01:12:39,929 --> 01:12:42,263
Hope can drive a man insane.

926
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:45,141
It's got no use on the inside.

927
01:12:45,351 --> 01:12:47,560
You'd better get used to that idea.

928
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:51,564
Like Brooks did?

929
01:13:16,924 --> 01:13:17,924
Sit down.

930
01:13:23,264 --> 01:13:26,558
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

931
01:13:27,727 --> 01:13:29,769
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

932
01:13:29,979 --> 01:13:31,229
Oh, yes, sir.

933
01:13:32,481 --> 01:13:33,815
Without a doubt.

934
01:13:34,984 --> 01:13:37,402
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

935
01:13:39,405 --> 01:13:41,322
No danger to society here.

936
01:13:41,866 --> 01:13:43,408
God's honest truth.

937
01:13:45,953 --> 01:13:48,079
Absolutely rehabilitated.

938
01:13:58,049 --> 01:13:59,382
Thirty years.

939
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,261
Jesus, when you say it like that...

940
01:14:04,138 --> 01:14:05,930
You wonder where it went.

941
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,518
I wonder where 10 years went.

942
01:14:15,483 --> 01:14:16,524
Here.

943
01:14:16,984 --> 01:14:19,694
A little parole rejection present.

944
01:14:20,988 --> 01:14:22,655
Go ahead and open it.

945
01:14:23,783 --> 01:14:25,825
Went through one of your competitors.

946
01:14:25,993 --> 01:14:29,162
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

947
01:14:39,173 --> 01:14:40,673
It's very pretty.

948
01:14:42,384 --> 01:14:43,593
Thank you.

949
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,639
You going to play it?

950
01:14:52,186 --> 01:14:53,478
No.

951
01:14:57,066 --> 01:14:58,483
Not right now.

952
01:15:16,168 --> 01:15:17,252
Roll in!

953
01:15:53,455 --> 01:15:54,706
Lights out!

954
01:16:29,283 --> 01:16:31,451
Andy was as good as his word.

955
01:16:31,785 --> 01:16:34,579
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

956
01:16:36,624 --> 01:16:40,752
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

957
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:44,130
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

958
01:16:44,298 --> 01:16:48,635
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

959
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:50,720
just to shut him up.

960
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,932
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

961
01:16:54,141 --> 01:16:57,060
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

962
01:16:57,269 --> 01:17:00,021
He bought remaindered books
by the pound...

963
01:17:00,522 --> 01:17:02,065
Treasure Island.

964
01:17:02,608 --> 01:17:05,151
Robert Louis... Stevenson.

965
01:17:05,361 --> 01:17:06,778
Fiction, adventure.

966
01:17:09,323 --> 01:17:10,365
What's next?

967
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:13,618
I got here Auto Repair...

968
01:17:14,328 --> 01:17:15,495
and Soap Carving.

969
01:17:15,704 --> 01:17:18,957
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

970
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:21,000
Count of Monte Crisco.

971
01:17:21,502 --> 01:17:23,795
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

972
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,880
By Alexandree...

973
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:27,632
Dum-ass.

974
01:17:27,967 --> 01:17:29,008
Dumb-ass.

975
01:17:31,303 --> 01:17:32,345
Dumb-ass?

976
01:17:35,266 --> 01:17:37,225
Dumas. Know what that's about?

977
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,521
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

978
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:45,566
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

979
01:17:46,443 --> 01:17:50,530
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

980
01:17:51,115 --> 01:17:52,865
By the year Kennedy was shot...

981
01:17:53,117 --> 01:17:57,620
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

982
01:17:57,913 --> 01:18:01,040
into the best prison library
in New England...

983
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:04,669
complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

984
01:18:12,052 --> 01:18:13,970
That was also when Warden Norton...

985
01:18:14,179 --> 01:18:17,098
instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

986
01:18:17,558 --> 01:18:19,642
You may remember reading about it.

987
01:18:19,893 --> 01:18:22,979
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

988
01:18:23,188 --> 01:18:24,522
It's no free ride...

989
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:27,900
but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

990
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:30,611
in corrections and rehabilitation.

991
01:18:30,946 --> 01:18:33,489
Our inmates, properly supervised...

992
01:18:33,699 --> 01:18:36,326
will be put to work
outside these walls...

993
01:18:36,535 --> 01:18:39,620
performing all manner
of public service.

994
01:18:39,788 --> 01:18:42,582
These men can learn the value
of an honest day's labor...

995
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:46,586
while providing a valuable service
to the community...

996
01:18:46,795 --> 01:18:51,507
and at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

997
01:18:51,925 --> 01:18:54,260
Of course he didn't tell the press...

998
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:57,930
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

999
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:01,184
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1000
01:19:01,393 --> 01:19:03,895
Men, materials, you name it.

1001
01:19:04,229 --> 01:19:07,106
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1002
01:19:07,316 --> 01:19:09,859
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1003
01:19:10,069 --> 01:19:14,489
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1004
01:19:15,074 --> 01:19:18,034
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1005
01:19:18,243 --> 01:19:21,913
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1006
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,125
We go back a long way.

1007
01:19:27,419 --> 01:19:32,340
I need this highway contract. I don't
get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1008
01:19:33,258 --> 01:19:35,051
You have some of this fine pie...

1009
01:19:35,302 --> 01:19:38,638
my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1010
01:19:46,897 --> 01:19:49,607
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1011
01:19:49,817 --> 01:19:52,902
It seems to me I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1012
01:19:54,863 --> 01:19:57,949
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1013
01:19:59,034 --> 01:20:01,202
And behind every shady deal...

1014
01:20:01,537 --> 01:20:04,163
behind every dollar earned...

1015
01:20:04,456 --> 01:20:07,500
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1016
01:20:07,918 --> 01:20:09,168
Two deposits.

1017
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:13,548
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1018
01:20:43,745 --> 01:20:48,082
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1019
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:52,086
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1020
01:20:52,296 --> 01:20:53,629
How do I look?

1021
01:20:54,673 --> 01:20:57,175
- Very nice.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1022
01:20:57,384 --> 01:20:58,885
Governor will be there.

1023
01:21:00,304 --> 01:21:01,762
You want the rest of this?

1024
01:21:03,098 --> 01:21:05,057
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1025
01:21:06,268 --> 01:21:07,602
Thank you, sir.

1026
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:13,691
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1027
01:21:13,901 --> 01:21:18,738
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1028
01:21:18,906 --> 01:21:21,282
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1029
01:21:21,492 --> 01:21:25,328
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1030
01:21:25,537 --> 01:21:27,288
That's where I come in.

1031
01:21:27,915 --> 01:21:30,208
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1032
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:33,252
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1033
01:21:33,587 --> 01:21:37,089
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back...

1034
01:21:37,299 --> 01:21:40,259
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
- Cleaner.

1035
01:21:40,886 --> 01:21:44,472
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1036
01:21:46,808 --> 01:21:51,145
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1037
01:21:51,438 --> 01:21:54,106
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1038
01:21:54,316 --> 01:21:57,360
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1039
01:21:57,736 --> 01:21:59,570
Now anybody gets curious...

1040
01:21:59,738 --> 01:22:02,156
FBI, IRS, whatever.

1041
01:22:02,616 --> 01:22:03,908
It'll lead to somebody.

1042
01:22:04,117 --> 01:22:07,954
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1043
01:22:12,334 --> 01:22:13,334
All right, who?

1044
01:22:13,502 --> 01:22:15,127
Randall Stevens.

1045
01:22:15,629 --> 01:22:16,629
Who?

1046
01:22:16,797 --> 01:22:18,798
The "silent" silent partner.

1047
01:22:19,007 --> 01:22:22,093
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1048
01:22:22,302 --> 01:22:24,470
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1049
01:22:24,638 --> 01:22:27,515
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1050
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:29,350
But who is he?

1051
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,521
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1052
01:22:34,648 --> 01:22:37,358
I conjured him...
out of thin air.

1053
01:22:38,151 --> 01:22:40,903
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1054
01:22:43,991 --> 01:22:46,325
You can't just make a person up.

1055
01:22:46,535 --> 01:22:49,662
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1056
01:22:50,163 --> 01:22:52,999
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1057
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:55,960
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1058
01:22:56,169 --> 01:22:58,296
driver's license, Social Security.

1059
01:22:58,547 --> 01:22:59,547
You're shitting me.

1060
01:22:59,715 --> 01:23:03,134
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1061
01:23:03,343 --> 01:23:05,052
a figment of my imagination.

1062
01:23:05,262 --> 01:23:07,263
Well, I'll be damned!

1063
01:23:08,599 --> 01:23:10,349
Did I say you were good?

1064
01:23:10,684 --> 01:23:12,351
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1065
01:23:13,061 --> 01:23:14,812
The funny thing is...

1066
01:23:15,022 --> 01:23:19,108
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1067
01:23:19,526 --> 01:23:21,861
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1068
01:23:30,704 --> 01:23:32,038
Ever bother you?

1069
01:23:33,457 --> 01:23:36,542
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1070
01:23:36,793 --> 01:23:38,794
A fine line, maybe...

1071
01:23:39,379 --> 01:23:41,422
but I also built that library...

1072
01:23:41,632 --> 01:23:44,675
and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1073
01:23:44,885 --> 01:23:47,094
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1074
01:23:47,304 --> 01:23:49,513
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1075
01:23:49,723 --> 01:23:51,182
Money instead of sheets.

1076
01:23:51,558 --> 01:23:54,143
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1077
01:24:11,411 --> 01:24:14,038
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1078
01:24:14,247 --> 01:24:16,499
on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1079
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:19,085
That's breaking and entering to you.

1080
01:24:19,336 --> 01:24:23,589
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1081
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:25,299
Young punk.

1082
01:24:25,509 --> 01:24:28,886
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...
cocky as hell.

1083
01:24:29,096 --> 01:24:31,472
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1084
01:24:31,723 --> 01:24:33,474
Making me look bad.

1085
01:24:33,684 --> 01:24:35,476
We liked him immediately.

1086
01:24:35,727 --> 01:24:39,438
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1087
01:24:39,773 --> 01:24:43,401
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1088
01:24:44,027 --> 01:24:45,986
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1089
01:24:46,196 --> 01:24:50,658
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1090
01:24:50,867 --> 01:24:54,662
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

1091
01:24:54,871 --> 01:24:58,332
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1092
01:25:02,796 --> 01:25:05,131
You done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1093
01:25:05,632 --> 01:25:09,593
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1094
01:25:09,845 --> 01:25:11,804
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

1095
01:25:12,472 --> 01:25:13,764
Not like here.

1096
01:25:13,932 --> 01:25:15,683
Sounds like you done time all over.

1097
01:25:16,143 --> 01:25:18,519
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1098
01:25:18,729 --> 01:25:20,938
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1099
01:25:21,148 --> 01:25:23,816
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1100
01:25:25,235 --> 01:25:26,819
What I mean is...

1101
01:25:27,154 --> 01:25:30,114
you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1102
01:25:30,824 --> 01:25:34,034
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1103
01:25:34,453 --> 01:25:36,036
What are you in for?

1104
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:37,329
Me?

1105
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:41,417
A lawyer fucked me.

1106
01:25:45,338 --> 01:25:48,299
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1107
01:25:56,183 --> 01:26:00,603
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1108
01:26:01,188 --> 01:26:03,314
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1109
01:26:03,523 --> 01:26:06,025
or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1110
01:26:06,318 --> 01:26:07,693
Whatever it was...

1111
01:26:08,028 --> 01:26:10,446
something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.

1112
01:26:14,284 --> 01:26:17,161
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1113
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:19,872
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1114
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:23,459
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1115
01:26:24,878 --> 01:26:27,379
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1116
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:30,925
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1117
01:26:32,594 --> 01:26:34,053
You really mean that?

1118
01:26:35,055 --> 01:26:36,430
Yes, sir, I do.

1119
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,599
Good. Because if we do this...

1120
01:26:38,809 --> 01:26:42,770
we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1121
01:26:43,021 --> 01:26:44,814
Thing is, see...

1122
01:26:46,066 --> 01:26:47,608
I don't read so good.

1123
01:26:48,777 --> 01:26:49,902
"Well."

1124
01:26:51,905 --> 01:26:53,614
You don't read...

1125
01:26:53,865 --> 01:26:55,407
so well.

1126
01:26:57,744 --> 01:26:59,245
We'll get to that.

1127
01:27:03,667 --> 01:27:05,793
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1128
01:27:06,002 --> 01:27:08,629
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1129
01:27:10,757 --> 01:27:12,967
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1130
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:16,011
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1131
01:27:18,348 --> 01:27:21,767
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1132
01:27:21,977 --> 01:27:23,644
He really liked the kid.

1133
01:27:23,854 --> 01:27:27,439
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1134
01:27:27,941 --> 01:27:30,192
But that wasn't the only reason.

1135
01:27:30,902 --> 01:27:33,112
Prison time is slow time.

1136
01:27:33,572 --> 01:27:36,156
So you do what you can to keep going.

1137
01:27:36,491 --> 01:27:38,576
Some fellas collect stamps.

1138
01:27:38,952 --> 01:27:41,453
Others build matchstick houses.

1139
01:27:42,038 --> 01:27:44,707
Andy built a library.

1140
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:47,126
Now he needed a new project.

1141
01:27:48,003 --> 01:27:49,503
Tommy was it.

1142
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:54,133
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1143
01:27:54,676 --> 01:27:57,928
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1144
01:27:58,805 --> 01:28:00,097
In prison...

1145
01:28:00,348 --> 01:28:04,101
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1146
01:28:04,853 --> 01:28:09,732
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1147
01:28:09,983 --> 01:28:12,151
it was lovely Raquel.

1148
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:29,710
Time.

1149
01:28:35,759 --> 01:28:37,009
Well?

1150
01:28:38,345 --> 01:28:40,512
Well, it's for shit.

1151
01:28:41,014 --> 01:28:43,849
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1152
01:28:44,017 --> 01:28:45,517
It's probably not that bad.

1153
01:28:45,727 --> 01:28:49,980
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1154
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:51,899
Let's see how the score comes out.

1155
01:28:52,108 --> 01:28:55,069
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1156
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:58,364
Two points, right there!

1157
01:28:58,573 --> 01:29:00,157
There's your goddamn score!

1158
01:29:00,367 --> 01:29:04,078
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1159
01:29:05,038 --> 01:29:06,664
Fuck this place!

1160
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:08,040
Fuck it!

1161
01:29:27,185 --> 01:29:28,435
I feel bad.

1162
01:29:28,645 --> 01:29:29,853
I let him down.

1163
01:29:30,063 --> 01:29:31,772
That's crap, kid.

1164
01:29:31,982 --> 01:29:33,315
He's proud of you.

1165
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:36,527
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1166
01:29:36,736 --> 01:29:38,278
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1167
01:29:38,488 --> 01:29:41,615
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1168
01:29:41,825 --> 01:29:44,076
What's he in here for anyway?

1169
01:29:44,369 --> 01:29:45,369
Murder.

1170
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:48,205
The hell, you say.

1171
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:52,668
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1172
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,007
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1173
01:30:06,016 --> 01:30:07,391
What?

1174
01:30:08,351 --> 01:30:10,936
About four years ago...

1175
01:30:11,187 --> 01:30:14,440
I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1176
01:30:14,941 --> 01:30:16,233
I stole a car.

1177
01:30:16,609 --> 01:30:18,610
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1178
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:21,488
About six months left to go...

1179
01:30:21,781 --> 01:30:23,699
I get a new cellmate in.

1180
01:30:24,409 --> 01:30:26,035
Elmo Blatch.

1181
01:30:26,745 --> 01:30:28,078
Big, twitchy fucker.

1182
01:30:28,955 --> 01:30:32,458
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1183
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:35,377
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1184
01:30:35,628 --> 01:30:37,921
Said he pulled hundreds ofjobs.

1185
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:43,052
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1186
01:30:44,137 --> 01:30:48,766
Talked all the time too.
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1187
01:30:48,975 --> 01:30:50,601
Places he'd been in...

1188
01:30:50,894 --> 01:30:53,979
jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1189
01:30:54,189 --> 01:30:56,398
Even people he killed.

1190
01:30:57,650 --> 01:31:00,444
People who "gave him shit."

1191
01:31:01,071 --> 01:31:02,654
That's how he put it.

1192
01:31:05,241 --> 01:31:07,326
So one night, like a joke...

1193
01:31:08,411 --> 01:31:11,914
I say to him,
"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1194
01:31:12,165 --> 01:31:13,290
So he says:

1195
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:17,419
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1196
01:31:18,088 --> 01:31:22,007
so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1197
01:31:24,094 --> 01:31:26,095
So I pick out this guy...

1198
01:31:27,013 --> 01:31:30,516
go in one night...
and do his place.

1199
01:31:31,935 --> 01:31:33,268
He wakes up...

1200
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,771
and gives me shit.

1201
01:31:36,856 --> 01:31:38,524
So I killed him.

1202
01:31:40,276 --> 01:31:43,112
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1203
01:31:44,531 --> 01:31:46,782
And that's the best part.

1204
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:49,910
She's fucking this prick, see...

1205
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:53,205
this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1206
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:56,375
Some hotshot banker.

1207
01:31:57,794 --> 01:32:00,295
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1208
01:32:11,766 --> 01:32:15,644
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1209
01:32:16,896 --> 01:32:19,398
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1210
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:21,150
Sir?

1211
01:32:23,361 --> 01:32:26,947
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1212
01:32:27,574 --> 01:32:31,493
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1213
01:32:31,703 --> 01:32:33,871
He's young, not terribly bright.

1214
01:32:34,414 --> 01:32:37,833
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1215
01:32:38,251 --> 01:32:39,793
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1216
01:32:40,587 --> 01:32:44,756
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1217
01:32:45,008 --> 01:32:49,636
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess."

1218
01:32:49,846 --> 01:32:52,556
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1219
01:32:52,765 --> 01:32:55,559
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1220
01:32:55,768 --> 01:32:58,228
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1221
01:32:58,438 --> 01:33:00,397
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1222
01:33:00,607 --> 01:33:05,194
They'd have his last known address, names
of relatives. It's a chance, isn't it?

1223
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:09,281
How can you be so obtuse?

1224
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,450
What?

1225
01:33:12,702 --> 01:33:14,161
What did you call me?

1226
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:16,121
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1227
01:33:16,456 --> 01:33:17,956
You're forgetting yourself.

1228
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:21,251
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1229
01:33:21,461 --> 01:33:24,213
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1230
01:33:24,422 --> 01:33:27,132
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1231
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,927
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1232
01:33:30,136 --> 01:33:32,721
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1233
01:33:33,348 --> 01:33:36,308
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1234
01:33:37,352 --> 01:33:41,146
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1235
01:33:41,314 --> 01:33:42,981
Not in this office...

1236
01:33:43,191 --> 01:33:45,150
not anywhere. Get in here, now!

1237
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,070
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1238
01:33:48,696 --> 01:33:50,822
- Solitary. A month.
- Yes, sir.

1239
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:53,784
- What's the matter with you?
- Get him out of here.

1240
01:33:53,993 --> 01:33:57,537
This is my chance to get out!
It's my life! Don't you understand?!

1241
01:33:57,747 --> 01:33:59,831
Get him out!

1242
01:34:01,584 --> 01:34:03,543
A month in the hole.

1243
01:34:03,753 --> 01:34:06,463
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1244
01:34:06,673 --> 01:34:07,965
It's all my fault.

1245
01:34:08,174 --> 01:34:09,758
Bullshit.

1246
01:34:10,426 --> 01:34:13,136
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1247
01:34:13,346 --> 01:34:15,722
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1248
01:34:15,932 --> 01:34:17,975
I mean, for real innocent?

1249
01:34:18,184 --> 01:34:19,518
It looks that way.

1250
01:34:19,936 --> 01:34:21,853
Sweet Jesus.

1251
01:34:22,105 --> 01:34:23,939
How long has he been here now?

1252
01:34:24,357 --> 01:34:27,609
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

1253
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:30,445
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1254
01:34:36,286 --> 01:34:37,452
What you got?

1255
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:39,413
Board of Education.

1256
01:34:39,622 --> 01:34:41,164
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1257
01:34:41,374 --> 01:34:45,335
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1258
01:34:45,545 --> 01:34:47,713
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1259
01:34:48,214 --> 01:34:51,049
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1260
01:34:51,884 --> 01:34:53,218
Floyd, come on.

1261
01:34:58,641 --> 01:35:01,059
Will you throw that away, please?

1262
01:35:06,649 --> 01:35:08,400
Well, shit.

1263
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,874
The kid passed. C-plus average.

1264
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:26,168
Thought you'd like to know.

1265
01:35:42,393 --> 01:35:43,852
Warden wants to talk.

1266
01:35:57,617 --> 01:35:58,658
Out here?

1267
01:35:58,868 --> 01:36:01,119
That's what the man said.

1268
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:18,470
Warden?

1269
01:36:28,231 --> 01:36:32,317
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1270
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:36,071
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1271
01:36:54,507 --> 01:36:56,591
We got a situation here.

1272
01:36:57,468 --> 01:36:59,553
I think you can appreciate that.

1273
01:36:59,762 --> 01:37:01,012
Yes, sir.

1274
01:37:01,264 --> 01:37:02,681
I sure can.

1275
01:37:02,932 --> 01:37:06,977
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1276
01:37:08,438 --> 01:37:11,022
It's got me up nights. That's the truth.

1277
01:37:13,276 --> 01:37:15,110
The right thing to do...

1278
01:37:16,779 --> 01:37:20,532
sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1279
01:37:21,534 --> 01:37:22,951
Do you understand?

1280
01:37:25,246 --> 01:37:26,872
I need your help, son.

1281
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:30,459
If I'm going to move on this...

1282
01:37:30,793 --> 01:37:33,962
there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1283
01:37:34,714 --> 01:37:35,755
I have to know...

1284
01:37:35,923 --> 01:37:38,592
if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1285
01:37:38,801 --> 01:37:39,926
Yes, sir.

1286
01:37:40,136 --> 01:37:41,386
Absolutely.

1287
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,890
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1288
01:37:45,057 --> 01:37:47,058
with your hand on the Good Book...

1289
01:37:47,268 --> 01:37:49,936
and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1290
01:37:50,146 --> 01:37:51,938
Just give me that chance.

1291
01:37:56,235 --> 01:37:57,569
That's what I thought.

1292
01:38:44,617 --> 01:38:46,535
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1293
01:38:48,287 --> 01:38:49,329
Terrible thing.

1294
01:38:50,957 --> 01:38:52,415
A man that young...

1295
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:55,335
less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1296
01:38:55,878 --> 01:38:58,380
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1297
01:38:59,131 --> 01:39:00,632
Truly, it did.

1298
01:39:03,636 --> 01:39:06,054
We just have to put it behind us.

1299
01:39:07,723 --> 01:39:08,974
Move on.

1300
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,060
I'm done.

1301
01:39:13,354 --> 01:39:14,980
Everything stops.

1302
01:39:16,983 --> 01:39:19,317
Get someone else to run your scams.

1303
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:22,404
Nothing stops.

1304
01:39:23,739 --> 01:39:25,115
Nothing.

1305
01:39:28,327 --> 01:39:31,413
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1306
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:34,165
No more protection from the guards.

1307
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:39,254
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1308
01:39:40,673 --> 01:39:43,091
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1309
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:46,011
And the library?

1310
01:39:46,679 --> 01:39:47,679
Gone.

1311
01:39:48,264 --> 01:39:50,849
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1312
01:39:51,309 --> 01:39:53,977
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1313
01:39:54,186 --> 01:39:56,313
They'll see the flames for miles.

1314
01:39:56,522 --> 01:39:59,357
We'll dance around it like wild lnjuns.

1315
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:03,612
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1316
01:40:07,366 --> 01:40:09,200
Or am I being obtuse?

1317
01:40:21,005 --> 01:40:23,632
Give him another month
to think about it.

1318
01:41:10,388 --> 01:41:13,431
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1319
01:41:14,266 --> 01:41:16,101
Like a closed book.

1320
01:41:16,894 --> 01:41:18,937
Complained about it all the time.

1321
01:41:19,855 --> 01:41:21,439
She was beautiful.

1322
01:41:23,818 --> 01:41:25,652
God, I loved her.

1323
01:41:29,073 --> 01:41:31,282
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1324
01:41:34,036 --> 01:41:35,704
I killed her, Red.

1325
01:41:37,581 --> 01:41:39,374
I didn't pull the trigger...

1326
01:41:40,793 --> 01:41:42,544
but I drove her away.

1327
01:41:44,046 --> 01:41:46,756
That's why she died, because of me...

1328
01:41:46,924 --> 01:41:48,299
the way I am.

1329
01:41:57,309 --> 01:41:59,144
That don't make you a murderer.

1330
01:42:02,523 --> 01:42:04,315
Bad husband, maybe.

1331
01:42:07,945 --> 01:42:11,197
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1332
01:42:11,407 --> 01:42:12,741
No, I didn't.

1333
01:42:13,159 --> 01:42:15,076
Somebody else did.

1334
01:42:16,328 --> 01:42:18,413
And I wound up in here.

1335
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:22,500
Bad luck, I guess.

1336
01:42:27,673 --> 01:42:29,132
It floats around.

1337
01:42:30,176 --> 01:42:32,385
It's got to land on somebody.

1338
01:42:33,304 --> 01:42:35,180
It was my turn, that's all.

1339
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:38,683
I was in the path of the tornado.

1340
01:42:44,607 --> 01:42:48,568
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1341
01:42:52,907 --> 01:42:54,616
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1342
01:42:55,868 --> 01:42:57,285
Me?

1343
01:42:59,872 --> 01:43:01,206
Yeah.

1344
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:04,501
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1345
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:08,797
and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1346
01:43:09,882 --> 01:43:11,549
I tell you where I'd go.

1347
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:14,719
Zihuatanejo.

1348
01:43:15,554 --> 01:43:16,721
Say what?

1349
01:43:17,056 --> 01:43:18,890
Zihuatanejo.

1350
01:43:19,809 --> 01:43:21,476
It's in Mexico.

1351
01:43:22,853 --> 01:43:24,979
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1352
01:43:26,106 --> 01:43:28,900
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1353
01:43:30,736 --> 01:43:32,737
They say it has no memory.

1354
01:43:34,698 --> 01:43:37,367
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1355
01:43:38,994 --> 01:43:41,496
A warm place with no memory.

1356
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:46,668
Open up a little hotel...

1357
01:43:48,379 --> 01:43:49,879
right on the beach.

1358
01:43:50,464 --> 01:43:52,674
Buy some worthless old boat...

1359
01:43:53,217 --> 01:43:54,843
and fix it up new.

1360
01:43:57,596 --> 01:43:58,805
Take my guests out...

1361
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,015
charter fishing.

1362
01:44:04,854 --> 01:44:06,604
Zihuatanejo.

1363
01:44:10,109 --> 01:44:13,987
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1364
01:44:20,536 --> 01:44:23,371
I don't think I could make it
on the outside.

1365
01:44:30,045 --> 01:44:32,130
I been in here most of my life.

1366
01:44:33,549 --> 01:44:35,300
I'm an institutional man now.

1367
01:44:36,218 --> 01:44:37,969
Just like Brooks was.

1368
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:41,139
You underestimate yourself.

1369
01:44:41,682 --> 01:44:43,308
I don't think so.

1370
01:44:47,146 --> 01:44:51,065
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1371
01:44:51,817 --> 01:44:54,360
outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1372
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:56,821
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1373
01:44:58,949 --> 01:45:00,575
Pacific Ocean?

1374
01:45:00,993 --> 01:45:02,201
Shit.

1375
01:45:02,578 --> 01:45:04,787
Scare me to death, something that big.

1376
01:45:04,997 --> 01:45:06,289
Not me.

1377
01:45:07,499 --> 01:45:10,251
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1378
01:45:12,004 --> 01:45:15,214
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1379
01:45:16,258 --> 01:45:17,759
That hotel, that boat...

1380
01:45:19,511 --> 01:45:21,763
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1381
01:45:26,685 --> 01:45:29,103
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1382
01:45:29,313 --> 01:45:31,356
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1383
01:45:31,774 --> 01:45:34,233
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1384
01:45:34,443 --> 01:45:36,027
and that's the way it is.

1385
01:45:36,362 --> 01:45:39,197
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1386
01:45:40,699 --> 01:45:43,076
It's down there and I'm in here.

1387
01:45:45,663 --> 01:45:48,373
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1388
01:45:51,293 --> 01:45:52,794
Get busy living...

1389
01:45:54,171 --> 01:45:56,214
or get busy dying.

1390
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:11,062
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1391
01:46:11,230 --> 01:46:13,523
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1392
01:46:15,401 --> 01:46:19,237
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1393
01:46:20,739 --> 01:46:23,866
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1394
01:46:24,076 --> 01:46:27,996
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1395
01:46:28,205 --> 01:46:31,082
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1396
01:46:32,001 --> 01:46:34,502
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1397
01:46:35,921 --> 01:46:38,006
We went there for a picnic...

1398
01:46:38,424 --> 01:46:40,508
and made love under that oak...

1399
01:46:41,176 --> 01:46:43,428
and I asked and she said yes.

1400
01:46:47,433 --> 01:46:49,267
Promise me, Red.

1401
01:46:50,102 --> 01:46:53,438
If you ever get out...
find that spot.

1402
01:46:54,606 --> 01:46:59,444
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1403
01:47:00,571 --> 01:47:03,614
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1404
01:47:06,285 --> 01:47:08,953
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1405
01:47:09,705 --> 01:47:10,955
What, Andy?

1406
01:47:11,373 --> 01:47:13,124
What's buried under there?

1407
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:18,046
You'll have to pry it up...
to see.

1408
01:47:24,053 --> 01:47:25,887
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1409
01:47:26,555 --> 01:47:28,306
He's talking funny.

1410
01:47:29,391 --> 01:47:31,100
I'm really worried about him.

1411
01:47:31,477 --> 01:47:32,935
Let's keep an eye on him.

1412
01:47:33,145 --> 01:47:36,397
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1413
01:47:37,816 --> 01:47:38,983
Oh, Lord.

1414
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:41,903
What?

1415
01:47:42,654 --> 01:47:45,406
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1416
01:47:45,616 --> 01:47:47,700
He asked me for a length of rope.

1417
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:50,620
- Rope?
- Six feet long.

1418
01:47:50,829 --> 01:47:52,205
And you gave it to him.

1419
01:47:53,082 --> 01:47:54,874
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1420
01:47:55,084 --> 01:47:56,667
Jesus! Heywood.

1421
01:47:57,252 --> 01:47:59,212
How was I supposed to know?

1422
01:47:59,421 --> 01:48:01,005
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1423
01:48:03,008 --> 01:48:04,926
Andy would never do that.

1424
01:48:05,511 --> 01:48:06,969
Never.

1425
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:10,014
I don't know.

1426
01:48:12,851 --> 01:48:14,852
Every man has his breaking point.

1427
01:48:17,189 --> 01:48:19,482
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1428
01:48:19,775 --> 01:48:21,526
Just about finished, sir.

1429
01:48:38,669 --> 01:48:40,294
Three deposits tonight.

1430
01:48:48,262 --> 01:48:50,179
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1431
01:48:50,389 --> 01:48:52,014
And shine my shoes.

1432
01:48:52,224 --> 01:48:55,143
- I want them looking like mirrors.
- Yes, sir.

1433
01:49:00,649 --> 01:49:02,108
It's good having you back.

1434
01:49:03,068 --> 01:49:04,902
Place wasn't the same without you.

1435
01:49:51,783 --> 01:49:53,159
Lights out!

1436
01:50:25,692 --> 01:50:28,236
I've had some long nights in the stir.

1437
01:50:28,779 --> 01:50:31,447
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1438
01:50:31,657 --> 01:50:34,325
time can draw out like a blade.

1439
01:50:39,665 --> 01:50:42,667
That was the longest night of my life.

1440
01:50:58,517 --> 01:50:59,684
Give me a count!

1441
01:51:04,189 --> 01:51:07,024
Tier 3 south, clear!

1442
01:51:10,153 --> 01:51:13,322
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1443
01:51:13,532 --> 01:51:14,573
Dufresne!

1444
01:51:15,117 --> 01:51:17,535
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1445
01:51:20,706 --> 01:51:24,083
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1446
01:51:31,675 --> 01:51:35,511
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1447
01:51:35,721 --> 01:51:39,015
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1448
01:51:39,224 --> 01:51:40,558
You hear me?

1449
01:51:46,648 --> 01:51:48,733
Oh, my Holy God.

1450
01:52:05,751 --> 01:52:08,294
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1451
01:52:08,754 --> 01:52:11,297
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1452
01:52:11,465 --> 01:52:12,882
Him.

1453
01:52:13,884 --> 01:52:15,426
Open 237.

1454
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:22,600
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1455
01:52:23,477 --> 01:52:26,062
- Don't say that to me again.
- But, sir, he wasn't.

1456
01:52:26,271 --> 01:52:29,774
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?

1457
01:52:30,442 --> 01:52:32,026
Is that what you're saying?

1458
01:52:32,194 --> 01:52:34,695
- Am I blind, Haig?
- No, sir!

1459
01:52:35,614 --> 01:52:38,115
What about you. You blind?

1460
01:52:38,617 --> 01:52:41,160
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1461
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:44,663
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1462
01:52:44,873 --> 01:52:46,207
"Dufresne."

1463
01:52:47,876 --> 01:52:50,628
He was in his cell at lights out.

1464
01:52:50,796 --> 01:52:53,714
Stands to reason he'd still be here
in the morning.

1465
01:52:54,049 --> 01:52:55,674
I want him found.

1466
01:52:55,884 --> 01:52:59,345
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1467
01:52:59,596 --> 01:53:00,805
Yes, sir.

1468
01:53:01,807 --> 01:53:05,601
Let's go. Move your butts. Move it!

1469
01:53:07,479 --> 01:53:08,479
Stand.

1470
01:53:09,898 --> 01:53:11,315
Well?

1471
01:53:14,403 --> 01:53:15,444
Well, what?

1472
01:53:15,612 --> 01:53:19,073
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1473
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:21,659
He must have said something.

1474
01:53:22,369 --> 01:53:25,287
No, sir, warden. Not a word.

1475
01:53:27,082 --> 01:53:29,667
Lord, it's a miracle!

1476
01:53:30,252 --> 01:53:32,837
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1477
01:53:33,505 --> 01:53:34,672
Nothing left...

1478
01:53:35,507 --> 01:53:38,217
but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1479
01:53:38,427 --> 01:53:41,178
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1480
01:53:41,346 --> 01:53:43,139
Maybe she knows.

1481
01:53:43,348 --> 01:53:46,100
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1482
01:53:47,519 --> 01:53:48,853
Guess not.

1483
01:53:49,396 --> 01:53:51,605
Why should she be any different?

1484
01:53:52,691 --> 01:53:54,358
This is a conspiracy.

1485
01:53:54,985 --> 01:53:56,694
That's what this is.

1486
01:53:57,404 --> 01:54:01,157
One big, damn conspiracy!

1487
01:54:01,408 --> 01:54:03,409
And everyone's in on it!

1488
01:54:04,035 --> 01:54:05,202
Including her!

1489
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:44,575
In 1966... Andy
Dufresne escaped...

1490
01:54:44,743 --> 01:54:46,327
from Shawshank Prison.

1491
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:51,123
All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1492
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:55,085
a bar of soap... and
an old rock hammer...

1493
01:54:55,253 --> 01:54:57,755
damn near worn down to the nub.

1494
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:07,014
I remember thinking it would take a man 600
years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1495
01:55:07,641 --> 01:55:10,267
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1496
01:55:28,578 --> 01:55:30,871
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1497
01:55:31,623 --> 01:55:34,792
I imagine it appealed to
his meticulous nature.

1498
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:37,044
An ice age here...

1499
01:55:37,462 --> 01:55:39,964
million years
of mountain-building there.

1500
01:55:40,966 --> 01:55:43,801
Geology is the study
of pressure and time.

1501
01:55:44,636 --> 01:55:46,637
That's all it takes, really.

1502
01:55:47,389 --> 01:55:48,681
Pressure...

1503
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:50,641
and time.

1504
01:55:51,726 --> 01:55:53,811
That and a big goddamn poster.

1505
01:55:57,607 --> 01:55:58,774
Like I said...

1506
01:55:59,276 --> 01:56:03,279
in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1507
01:56:06,074 --> 01:56:10,869
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1508
01:56:11,413 --> 01:56:13,330
a handful at a time.

1509
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:16,709
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1510
01:56:16,918 --> 01:56:19,878
Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.

1511
01:56:20,088 --> 01:56:22,673
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1512
01:56:23,383 --> 01:56:25,426
I'm just about finished, sir.

1513
01:56:46,865 --> 01:56:48,824
Three deposits tonight.

1514
01:56:56,124 --> 01:56:58,417
Andy did like he was told.

1515
01:56:58,627 --> 01:57:02,129
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1516
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:08,093
The guards simply didn't notice.

1517
01:57:08,386 --> 01:57:09,887
Neither did I.

1518
01:57:10,055 --> 01:57:11,597
I mean, seriously...

1519
01:57:11,806 --> 01:57:14,808
how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1520
01:59:18,349 --> 01:59:21,518
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1521
01:59:21,770 --> 01:59:25,105
of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1522
01:59:26,107 --> 01:59:28,442
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1523
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:35,199
Five hundred yards.

1524
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:38,786
That's the length
of five football fields.

1525
01:59:39,412 --> 01:59:41,997
Just shy of half a mile.

1526
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:41,807
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1527
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:44,935
a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1528
02:00:45,186 --> 02:00:47,771
strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1529
02:00:48,356 --> 02:00:51,525
Until that moment, he didn't exist.

1530
02:00:52,110 --> 02:00:54,444
- Except on paper.
- May I help you?

1531
02:00:54,863 --> 02:00:56,780
He had all the proper ID...

1532
02:00:56,990 --> 02:01:00,701
Driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card.

1533
02:01:01,119 --> 02:01:03,662
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1534
02:01:03,872 --> 02:01:06,957
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1535
02:01:07,166 --> 02:01:08,917
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1536
02:01:09,711 --> 02:01:11,295
Thank you.

1537
02:01:11,462 --> 02:01:12,629
I'm sure I will.

1538
02:01:13,548 --> 02:01:16,884
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1539
02:01:17,093 --> 02:01:18,093
Please.

1540
02:01:18,636 --> 02:01:21,138
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1541
02:01:21,639 --> 02:01:23,181
I'd be happy to.

1542
02:01:24,642 --> 02:01:25,976
Good day, sir.

1543
02:01:26,936 --> 02:01:31,356
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1544
02:01:31,816 --> 02:01:33,442
All told, he blew town...

1545
02:01:33,651 --> 02:01:38,488
with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1546
02:01:39,157 --> 02:01:41,950
Severance pay for 19 years.

1547
02:01:49,167 --> 02:01:51,376
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1548
02:02:44,222 --> 02:02:47,182
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1549
02:02:47,433 --> 02:02:51,895
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1550
02:02:52,313 --> 02:02:56,775
I wasn't there to see it, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1551
02:02:56,985 --> 02:02:58,485
when they took him away.

1552
02:03:04,367 --> 02:03:07,744
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1553
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:25,095
Samuel Norton.

1554
02:03:25,263 --> 02:03:27,681
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Open up.

1555
02:03:32,437 --> 02:03:33,895
Open the door.

1556
02:03:34,063 --> 02:03:35,313
I'm not sure which key.

1557
02:03:45,450 --> 02:03:47,409
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1558
02:03:58,921 --> 02:04:02,382
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1559
02:04:02,592 --> 02:04:04,176
other than that bullet...

1560
02:04:04,385 --> 02:04:08,805
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1561
02:04:11,309 --> 02:04:14,811
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1562
02:04:15,063 --> 02:04:17,147
I got a postcard in the mail.

1563
02:04:18,608 --> 02:04:21,443
It was blank, but the postmark said...

1564
02:04:21,652 --> 02:04:23,779
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1565
02:04:24,322 --> 02:04:25,655
Fort Hancock...

1566
02:04:25,948 --> 02:04:27,657
right on the border.

1567
02:04:28,076 --> 02:04:30,077
That's where Andy crossed.

1568
02:04:30,661 --> 02:04:34,790
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1569
02:04:35,124 --> 02:04:37,334
it always makes me laugh.

1570
02:04:39,170 --> 02:04:40,754
Andy Dufresne...

1571
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:43,173
who crawled through
a river of shit...

1572
02:04:43,341 --> 02:04:45,759
and came out clean
on the other side.

1573
02:04:46,594 --> 02:04:47,969
Andy Dufresne...

1574
02:04:48,763 --> 02:04:50,347
headed for the Pacific.

1575
02:04:53,351 --> 02:04:55,519
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1576
02:04:55,686 --> 02:04:59,523
He says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1577
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:02,567
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1578
02:05:03,236 --> 02:05:04,945
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1579
02:05:05,154 --> 02:05:08,115
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1580
02:05:08,449 --> 02:05:10,117
And he got it!

1581
02:05:11,369 --> 02:05:13,745
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1582
02:05:14,038 --> 02:05:15,455
Andy being gone.

1583
02:05:16,165 --> 02:05:20,293
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1584
02:05:20,753 --> 02:05:22,838
Their feathers are just too bright.

1585
02:05:24,549 --> 02:05:26,258
And when they fly away...

1586
02:05:26,717 --> 02:05:31,096
the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1587
02:05:32,181 --> 02:05:33,431
But still...

1588
02:05:33,891 --> 02:05:38,228
the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1589
02:05:42,441 --> 02:05:44,818
I guess I just miss my friend.

1590
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:10,427
Please sit down.

1591
02:06:16,267 --> 02:06:17,851
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1592
02:06:18,394 --> 02:06:21,646
your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1593
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:24,608
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1594
02:06:26,444 --> 02:06:28,028
Rehabilitated?

1595
02:06:30,072 --> 02:06:31,948
Well, now, let me see.

1596
02:06:32,950 --> 02:06:35,285
I don't have any idea what that means.

1597
02:06:37,413 --> 02:06:39,664
It means you're ready
to rejoin society...

1598
02:06:40,249 --> 02:06:42,584
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1599
02:06:44,754 --> 02:06:46,755
To me it's just a made-up word.

1600
02:06:48,090 --> 02:06:50,425
A politician's word so that...

1601
02:06:50,843 --> 02:06:54,387
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1602
02:06:54,847 --> 02:06:56,473
and have a job.

1603
02:06:58,434 --> 02:07:00,518
What do you really want to know?

1604
02:07:01,312 --> 02:07:03,271
Am I sorry for what I did?

1605
02:07:03,689 --> 02:07:04,981
Well, are you?

1606
02:07:06,776 --> 02:07:09,611
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1607
02:07:10,988 --> 02:07:14,449
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1608
02:07:17,912 --> 02:07:20,497
I look back on the way I was then...

1609
02:07:22,625 --> 02:07:23,959
a young...

1610
02:07:24,877 --> 02:07:28,380
stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1611
02:07:31,384 --> 02:07:33,093
I want to talk to him.

1612
02:07:35,012 --> 02:07:37,514
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1613
02:07:38,224 --> 02:07:40,183
Tell him the way things are.

1614
02:07:42,270 --> 02:07:43,687
But I can't.

1615
02:07:45,898 --> 02:07:47,899
That kid's long gone...

1616
02:07:49,110 --> 02:07:51,861
and this old man is all that's left.

1617
02:07:53,281 --> 02:07:54,739
I got to live with that.

1618
02:07:56,117 --> 02:07:57,826
Rehabilitated?

1619
02:07:58,202 --> 02:08:00,036
It's just a bullshit word.

1620
02:08:00,955 --> 02:08:05,709
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1621
02:08:06,961 --> 02:08:09,212
Because to tell you the truth...

1622
02:08:09,547 --> 02:08:11,548
I don't give a shit.

1623
02:09:38,094 --> 02:09:39,469
Here you go, miss.

1624
02:09:42,431 --> 02:09:43,473
Restroom break?

1625
02:09:49,271 --> 02:09:53,817
You don't need to ask me every time you
need to go take a piss. Just go.

1626
02:09:54,819 --> 02:09:56,444
Yes, sir.

1627
02:10:06,831 --> 02:10:09,916
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1628
02:10:10,751 --> 02:10:13,753
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1629
02:10:17,258 --> 02:10:19,426
There's a harsh truth to face.

1630
02:10:21,095 --> 02:10:24,013
No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.

1631
02:10:31,856 --> 02:10:35,567
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1632
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:38,862
so maybe they'd send me back.

1633
02:10:44,034 --> 02:10:46,494
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1634
02:10:47,371 --> 02:10:49,038
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1635
02:10:49,248 --> 02:10:51,207
Knew it all too well.

1636
02:10:52,793 --> 02:10:56,212
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1637
02:10:56,630 --> 02:10:59,382
Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.

1638
02:11:01,385 --> 02:11:03,720
Only one thing stops me.

1639
02:11:05,181 --> 02:11:07,557
A promise I made to Andy.

1640
02:11:28,078 --> 02:11:29,412
There it is.

1641
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:41,508
Much obliged, sir.

1642
02:15:20,811 --> 02:15:22,103
Dear Red:

1643
02:15:22,312 --> 02:15:24,814
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1644
02:15:24,982 --> 02:15:29,152
and if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a bit further.

1645
02:15:29,319 --> 02:15:31,821
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1646
02:15:34,116 --> 02:15:35,616
Zihuatanejo.

1647
02:15:37,244 --> 02:15:40,830
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1648
02:15:41,331 --> 02:15:44,876
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1649
02:15:45,669 --> 02:15:47,086
Remember, Red...

1650
02:15:47,421 --> 02:15:49,505
hope is a good thing...

1651
02:15:49,715 --> 02:15:51,716
maybe the best of things.

1652
02:15:51,925 --> 02:15:54,093
And no good thing ever dies.

1653
02:15:54,636 --> 02:15:57,513
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1654
02:15:57,681 --> 02:15:59,432
and finds you well.

1655
02:15:59,933 --> 02:16:02,518
Your friend... Andy.

1656
02:16:36,386 --> 02:16:40,223
"Get busy living...
or get busy dying."

1657
02:16:42,893 --> 02:16:45,061
That's goddamn right.

1658
02:16:50,317 --> 02:16:52,443
For the second time in my life...

1659
02:16:52,694 --> 02:16:55,238
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1660
02:16:56,323 --> 02:16:58,241
Parole violation.

1661
02:16:58,909 --> 02:17:02,578
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1662
02:17:03,247 --> 02:17:05,289
Not for an old crook like me.

1663
02:17:05,499 --> 02:17:07,542
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1664
02:17:11,213 --> 02:17:15,925
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1665
02:17:16,385 --> 02:17:19,720
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1666
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:22,431
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1667
02:17:22,599 --> 02:17:25,226
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1668
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:30,898
I hope I can make it across the border.

1669
02:17:32,401 --> 02:17:35,444
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1670
02:17:37,281 --> 02:17:41,367
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1671
02:17:43,203 --> 02:17:44,412
I hope.

1672
02:18:22,115 --> 02:18:29,615
 Thanks for using the subs
     regards, shock
