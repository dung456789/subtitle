00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:26,750
(theme music punctuated by gunshots)

3
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:41,111
(dog howls)

4
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,836
(door bangs in the wind)

5
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:37,310
(gunfire)

6
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:37,318
You're from Baker?

7
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,581
Tell Baker I told him all I know already.

8
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:54,794
Tell him I want to live in peace,
that it's no use to go on tormenting me.

9
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:57,797
I know nothing about that case of coins.

10
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,260
Now that gold has disappeared, but if
he'd listened we could have avoided this.

11
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:06,972
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.

12
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:09,308
They couldn't uncover any more.

13
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,269
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

14
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,815
Go back and tell him that.

15
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,611
Word's around you had a visitor.

16
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:23,322
And Baker knows it.

17
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,243
Name of Jackson.

18
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:31,455
Well?

19
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:33,999
Jackson was here.

20
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,587
Or Baker's got it all wrong.

21
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:47,722
He's not wrong.

22
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:52,560
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

23
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:55,771
about the cash box.

24
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:01,694
That's not what I'm being paid for.

25
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:09,827
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

26
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:15,166
Why do you think
Jackson is assuming another name?

27
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:18,210
I would have found him already.

28
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:21,672
When I start off
to find somebody, I find 'em.

29
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:24,842
That's why they pay me.

30
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:31,515
What is Baker paying you?

31
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,938
That your family?

32
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:47,656
Yes.

33
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:51,243
Nice family.

34
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:55,539
What does he pay you for murdering me?

35
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:02,296
500 dollars, to get the name.

36
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,638
The name.

37
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:22,274
Carson... Bill Carson.

38
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,903
That's what he calls himself now.

39
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,811
It's a lot of money. One thousand.

40
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,275
A thousand dollars?

41
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:11,281
And some in gold. It's a tidy sum.

42
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:17,287
But when I'm paid...

43
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:20,499
I always see the job through.

44
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,688
(snoring)

45
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:35,657
It's you. Any information?

46
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:40,621
Too much.

47
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:43,665
He said quite a bit
that should interest you.

48
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:46,460
And one or two things that interested me.

49
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,712
Such as?

50
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:52,716
The name Jackson's hiding under
is Bill Carson.

51
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:58,597
That's your bit.

52
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:01,934
Keep talking.

53
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:05,896
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box

54
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,941
which just happened to disappear.

55
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:10,943
That's my bit.

56
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:13,153
Anything else?

57
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:15,489
Not enough for you, eh?

58
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:19,660
Well, you don't have to worry.
He'll never say anything to anybody again.

59
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:22,454
Oh, yeah. Perfect.

60
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,749
Here... Here you are.

61
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:29,294
Here, this is for you.
You did a good job for me.

62
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:31,880
Worth 500 dollars.

63
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:34,091
(coughs weakly)

64
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:37,386
Yeah. I almost forgot.

65
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:39,930
He gave me a thousand.

66
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:43,183
I think his idea
was that I kill you. (chuckles)

67
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:55,153
But you know, the pity is, when I'm paid
I always follow my job through.

68
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:57,030
You know that.

69
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:59,908
No! Angel Eyes!

70
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:21,763
(chuckles)

71
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:32,315
(gun cocking)

72
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,204
No. No pistol, amigo.

73
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:50,459
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.

74
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,308
Hey, amigo...

75
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:11,646
You know you got a face beautiful enough
to be worth 2,000 dollars?

76
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,523
(laughter)

77
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:16,485
(new voice) Yeah...

78
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:20,739
But you don't look like the one
who'll collect it.

79
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:29,915
A couple of steps back.

80
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:25,804
Thank you.

81
00:19:34,562 --> 00:19:36,898
How much are you worth now?

82
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:38,984
How much?

83
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,903
2,000 dollars.

84
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:46,074
That's right, 2,000 dollars.

85
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:48,868
2,000 dollars. (chuckles)

86
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:58,628
!Hijo de puta que te parió!
You'll pay for this!

87
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:01,214
I hope you end up in a graveyard,

88
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:04,301
with the cholera and the rabies
and the plague!

89
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:09,264
Cut me loose! Cut me loose,
you filthy bastard! Put me down!

90
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:12,309
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

91
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:14,811
Cut me loose!

92
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:20,817
You can still save yourself.
Let me go and I'll pardon you.

93
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,986
Let me go.

94
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:27,824
I feel sick.
The blood is rushing to my...

95
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:32,829
I'm dry, Blondie.
Agua... Water...

96
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:36,624
(dirty laugh)

97
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,128
You swine!

98
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:43,673
You son of a bitch! Let me go!

99
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:47,302
You're brave with a man who's tied up.
Come back.

100
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:50,138
Come back and fight.

101
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:52,098
You bastard.

102
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:56,936
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

103
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,690
- Cut it out.
- I'm an honest farmer.

104
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:03,068
I'm innocent of everything.

105
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,905
So you're an honest farmer?

106
00:21:06,988 --> 00:21:09,532
You recognise this man?

107
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:12,494
Yeah, it's you.

108
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:16,581
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.

109
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:20,960
Roll it up. I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

110
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:24,589
To hell with all you sheriffs
and all who gave birth to you.

111
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:28,092
Hey, everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

112
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:33,556
Judas! You sold my hide. But you won't
enjoy that money, not a penny.

113
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,727
If there's justice in the world,
that money will go to the undertaker.

114
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,687
You know who you are?

115
00:21:39,771 --> 00:21:42,148
Want to know whose son you are?

116
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,692
You don't. I do. Everybody does.

117
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:48,321
You're the son of a thousand fathers,
all bastards like you.

118
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:51,199
And your mother, she's...

119
00:21:51,282 --> 00:21:53,660
You bastard!

120
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:58,373
Your mother, it's better not to talk of her!
I never hurt anybody!

121
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:04,546
Wanted in 1 4 counties of this state,
the condemned is found guilty

122
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:11,719
of the crimes of murder, armed robbery
of citizens, state banks and post offices,

123
00:22:11,803 --> 00:22:15,723
the theft of sacred objects,
arson in a state prison,

124
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:20,603
perjury, bigamy,
deserting his wife and children,

125
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,189
inciting prostitution, kidnapping,

126
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:27,777
extortion, receiving stolen goods,
selling stolen goods,

127
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,949
passing counterfeit money, and,
contrary to the laws of this state,

128
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:37,495
the condemned is guilty
of using marked cards...

129
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:41,666
Therefore, according
to the powers vested in us,

130
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:44,752
we sentence the accused here before us,

131
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:48,631
Tuco Benedicto Pacífico
Juan-Maria Ramirez...

132
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:51,843
Known as "The Rat".

133
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:55,680
..to hang by the neck until dead.

134
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:59,309
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

135
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:27,378
Five for you.

136
00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:31,632
One, two, three, four... five for me.

137
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:38,181
Five for you and five for me.

138
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:40,600
Know how much you're worth now?

139
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:44,145
- No. How much?
- 3,000 dollars.

140
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:47,065
(gratified grunt)

141
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:50,902
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend:

142
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:55,490
those with a rope around their neck
and the people who do the cutting.

143
00:23:55,573 --> 00:24:00,453
The neck at the end of the rope is mine.
I run the risks.

144
00:24:00,536 --> 00:24:04,248
So the next time I want more than half.

145
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:08,961
You may run the risks, my friend,
but I do the cutting.

146
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:14,258
If we cut down my percentage...

147
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:16,594
Cigar?

148
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:20,056
..Iiable to interfere with my aim.

149
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:26,187
But if you miss,
you had better miss very well.

150
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,274
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive,

151
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:34,320
he understands nothing about Tuco.

152
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:36,489
Nothing.

153
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:41,786
Wanted in 15 counties of this state,

154
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:45,581
the condemned standing before us...
sitting before us,

155
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:49,126
Tuco Benedicto Pacífico
Juan-Maria Ramirez,

156
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,214
has been found guilty by the circuit court
of the following crimes:

157
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:58,302
murder, assaulting a justice of the peace,
raping a virgin of the white race,

158
00:24:58,386 --> 00:25:01,764
statutory rape of a minor
of the black race,

159
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,432
derailing a train...

160
00:25:03,516 --> 00:25:06,143
Hey, Angel Eyes.

161
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:15,653
- What d'you find out, Shorty?
- If you ask me, it seems like a book.

162
00:25:15,736 --> 00:25:19,949
A unit escorting a cash box of gold coins
meets a Yankee ambush

163
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:24,954
and only three of 'em are saved -
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

164
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:27,582
What wasn't saved was the coins.

165
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:31,627
But the army holds a hearing,
and Jackson's acquitted.

166
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:34,547
He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.

167
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,801
- I know his name.
- But not who you're looking for. I do.

168
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:43,681
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.

169
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:46,559
Where is Carson?

170
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:49,854
All I know is Carson re-enlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.

171
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:54,275
He lives with a girl called Maria.
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

172
00:25:54,358 --> 00:25:57,612
- Where is she?
- Now, what's the name of that town?

173
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,488
Someplace fairly near.

174
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:03,326
Santa Ana.

175
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:09,582
Adios, half-soldier.

176
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:15,212
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey.

177
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:17,548
..and the sheriff's office in Sonora.

178
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:20,718
He then hired himself out
as guide to a wagon train,

179
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:23,054
and, after receiving payment in advance,

180
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:26,599
deserted the wagon train on
the hunting grounds of the Sioux Indians.

181
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:30,519
I'm glad they got him.
A man guilty of all those crimes.

182
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:35,191
- Convicted people don't always hang.
- What do you mean?

183
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:39,362
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

184
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:50,206
A golden-haired angel watches over him.

185
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:54,126
(judge) For all these crimes,
the accused has made a full confession.

186
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,755
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead.

187
00:26:57,838 --> 00:27:00,716
May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

188
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:19,360
Let's get the hell out of here!

189
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:52,685
What are you trying to say?
Anybody can miss a shot?

190
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:54,812
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope.

191
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:58,274
You never had a rope round your neck.
Let me tell you something.

192
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:03,654
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feel the devil bite your ass.

193
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:07,741
Yeah. You're right.

194
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,494
It's getting tougher.

195
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:17,167
The way I figure, there's really not too
much future with a sawn-off runt like you.

196
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:18,544
What do you mean?

197
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:22,548
I don't think you'll ever
be worth more than 3,000 dollars.

198
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:25,593
What do you mean?

199
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:28,512
I mean our partnership is untied.

200
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:31,599
Oh, no, not you.

201
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:33,475
You remain tied.

202
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,562
I'll keep the money
and you can have the rope.

203
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:40,774
You filthy, double-crossing bastard.
Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...

204
00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:43,861
The way back to town is only 70 miles.

205
00:28:44,945 --> 00:28:48,157
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

206
00:28:48,782 --> 00:28:49,992
Adios.

207
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:53,287
You filthy bastard! Come here!

208
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:58,751
Come here. Cut this rope off.
Get off that horse, you filthy coward.

209
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:02,087
If I ever catch you, Blondie,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

210
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:07,176
I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up
by your thumbs! You pig! You vulture!

211
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,803
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

212
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,764
(tsks)

213
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:16,226
Such ingratitude.
After all the times I've saved your life.

214
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:23,901
Wait a minute.
This is only a trick.

215
00:29:23,984 --> 00:29:26,945
You wouldn't leave me here. Come back.

216
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:30,866
Wait, Blondie! Listen...

217
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:34,370
!Hijo de una gran puta!

218
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:37,539
(echoes into theme music)

219
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:46,924
(drunken singing)

220
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,098
(laughter)

221
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:58,268
I believe madam is home.

222
00:29:58,352 --> 00:30:00,437
Sweet dreams.

223
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:14,034
You filthy rats!

224
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:31,969
(man, quietly) Maria?

225
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:41,145
Is that you, Bill?

226
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:43,147
Bill!

227
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:46,108
Arh!

228
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:54,158
Who are you?

229
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:56,201
What do you want with me?

230
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:59,621
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

231
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:02,416
I don't know him.

232
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:05,752
You were calling to him in the dark.

233
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,716
Where is he?

234
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,135
What are you gonna do to him?

235
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:16,722
I'll ask the questions.

236
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:20,934
Where is he?

237
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:29,568
Where is he? Where?

238
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:32,362
Where? Where?

239
00:31:32,446 --> 00:31:34,740
Where?

240
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:39,620
That's enough.

241
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:44,166
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago

242
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:47,586
and went away with his unit. They all left.

243
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:49,838
Which company? Where did they go?

244
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:53,884
Hm?

245
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:58,889
3rd Cavalry. General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.

246
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:03,185
That's all I know. I swear.

247
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:59,032
(pained gasp)

248
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:30,689
But... but...

249
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:37,529
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

250
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:39,281
Mm-hm.

251
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,045
(chuckles)

252
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:19,613
- Revolvers!
- Yeah, revolvers.

253
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:25,118
Revolvers.

254
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:29,456
Well, here's where I keep the best ones.

255
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:36,880
Here, Remington, Colt,

256
00:34:36,963 --> 00:34:39,758
a Root, Smith-Wesson,

257
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:44,137
Colt - navy, Joslyn,

258
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,431
another Remington, and this one...

259
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:47,974
That's enough.

260
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:33,645
Cartridges.

261
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:45,699
- You wanna try the pistol, step out back.
- Let's go.

262
00:35:50,745 --> 00:35:52,831
Move, move.

263
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:43,715
(chuckles)

264
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:09,741
Cartridge.

265
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:20,752
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

266
00:37:21,794 --> 00:37:24,839
(chuckles) No.

267
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:30,595
Fifty dollars.

268
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:35,141
- How much?
- A hundred dollars.

269
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:41,356
Two hundred dollars. It's all I've got.

270
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,524
Here.

271
00:38:02,502 --> 00:38:05,004
Come here.

272
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:12,762
- Aaah..
- Ahh...

273
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:18,518
- (chuckles) Heh?
- Mm-hm.

274
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:28,319
(Tuco) If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

275
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:11,946
If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

276
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,475
Potatoes.

277
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:44,479
You've gotta be poor to eat potatoes.

278
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:47,523
Really poor.

279
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:51,152
I'm rich. But I'm lonely.

280
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:56,282
The world is divided into two parts:

281
00:39:56,365 --> 00:40:02,371
those who have friends,
and those who are lonely, like poor Tuco.

282
00:40:03,998 --> 00:40:08,878
You see, I used to have a friend - Pedro.

283
00:40:09,795 --> 00:40:13,382
Chico and Ramón, his two brothers,
were my friends too.

284
00:40:16,844 --> 00:40:20,139
But who knows where they are now?

285
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,685
Ah, it's too bad, friends.
Tough luck I haven't found you.

286
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:27,063
I had a good deal for you.

287
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:33,277
There's a big son of a bitch
who's got 4,000 dollars.

288
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:39,700
4,000 dollars.
And I know where to find it.

289
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,500
If they would help me catch him,
I'd divide it four ways, like a brother.

290
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:51,295
1 ,000 dollars each. Hm?

291
00:41:08,521 --> 00:41:11,607
You're alive, Tuco. Is it true?

292
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:16,946
And rich. Like you're going to be.

293
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:19,949
But people are saying
you got killed in Albuquerque.

294
00:41:20,032 --> 00:41:22,285
And people talk bullshit.

295
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:29,333
I'm alive, you bastards,
and I always will be.

296
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:32,753
And I've come to give you 3,000 dollars.

297
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:34,922
Vamos.

298
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:53,232
This morning I heard the whole thing.

299
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:58,487
Canby's closing in with his northerners
and tomorrow they'll be in the city.

300
00:41:58,571 --> 00:42:01,282
That's why these southerners
are getting out.

301
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:04,827
As soon as these cowards
hear of blue-shirts around, they run.

302
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,789
- These rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.

303
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:14,170
They'll soon be finished. Then we begin
making money on those Yankees.

304
00:42:14,253 --> 00:42:16,630
They carry gold, not paper dollars.

305
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:19,592
And they're going to beat the South.

306
00:42:19,675 --> 00:42:24,889
Look. See that one with the white beard,
General Sibley? He looks dead.

307
00:42:24,972 --> 00:42:26,974
He's finally getting out of our hair.

308
00:42:27,057 --> 00:42:31,937
Hooray for Dixie!
Hooray, hooray for Dixie!

309
00:42:35,649 --> 00:42:38,736
Where's the owner of that horse?

310
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:41,989
- Please, mister... A bad heart...
- Where?

311
00:42:42,072 --> 00:42:47,077
- The war's frightened me already.
- I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

312
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:52,249
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

313
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:55,211
He doesn't know who rides every horse.

314
00:42:55,294 --> 00:42:58,881
You stay quiet, old hen.

315
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:03,135
Upstairs in room four, señor.

316
00:43:08,224 --> 00:43:10,518
Hear that?

317
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:19,151
You rotten criminals. How dare you?

318
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:24,448
(rumble of wagons outside)

319
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:25,444
(chink of spurs)

320
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,660
(distant cannon fire)

321
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:35,389
Your spurs.

322
00:46:43,438 --> 00:46:45,524
(Tuco chuckles)

323
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:52,406
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend:

324
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:57,953
those that come in by the door,
and those that come in by the window.

325
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:01,164
Take off that pistol belt.

326
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:09,089
It's empty.

327
00:47:11,717 --> 00:47:15,012
- Mine isn't.
- (closer cannon fire)

328
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:23,770
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

329
00:47:27,107 --> 00:47:29,484
That could be cannon fire.

330
00:47:29,568 --> 00:47:34,114
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

331
00:47:35,615 --> 00:47:39,536
You ever see this before, my friend?

332
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:51,173
Throw it over the roof beam.

333
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,300
That's it.

334
00:48:04,978 --> 00:48:07,064
Now get on that.

335
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:18,784
That's right.

336
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:21,369
Now make sure the rope is tight.

337
00:48:21,453 --> 00:48:24,581
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.

338
00:48:30,879 --> 00:48:34,382
Now put the rope around your neck.

339
00:48:40,222 --> 00:48:43,058
That's very good.

340
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:46,978
It's too big for your neck, huh?
We fix that right away.

341
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:51,316
I have another system.
A little different than yours.

342
00:48:52,234 --> 00:48:56,446
I don't shoot the rope,
I shoot the legs off the stool.

343
00:49:00,992 --> 00:49:03,078
Adiós.

344
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,227
Welcome, my friend.

345
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,814
If you're looking for a summer
vacation spot, you've found it.

346
00:52:17,897 --> 00:52:21,401
Our hotel is luxurious
and filled with conveniences.

347
00:52:21,484 --> 00:52:23,361
(laughter)

348
00:52:23,444 --> 00:52:25,572
And the attractions don't stop there.

349
00:52:25,655 --> 00:52:29,868
International cuisine,
healthful and nutritious food.

350
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:32,036
Corn cobs, Dixie-style.

351
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,622
Our government has spared no expense.

352
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:37,584
As you can see, we are treated very well.

353
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:41,254
Have you ever heard of anyone
by the name of Bill Carson?

354
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:46,509
And you? Have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

355
00:52:46,593 --> 00:52:50,930
Well, you see, he's a Yankee colonel
who decided to tear us to pieces.

356
00:52:51,014 --> 00:52:54,100
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

357
00:52:54,183 --> 00:52:57,103
And you ask me if I know someone.

358
00:52:57,186 --> 00:53:01,357
I just don't know what you drifters
could be thinking.

359
00:53:12,118 --> 00:53:16,289
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the 3rd.

360
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:22,086
If he's with the 3rd...
They've already left.

361
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,796
For Glorietta.

362
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,092
Canby's front line is right on their heels.
Those poor young devils.

363
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:34,098
And the desert lies ahead of 'em. I really
doubt that any of them are still alive.

364
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:36,726
And what if they were still alive?

365
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:41,314
Worse.

366
00:53:41,397 --> 00:53:45,068
Well, then, you must not have
heard anything about Batterville.

367
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:51,032
It's one of those Yankee prison camps
you'd better hope you never end up in.

368
00:53:51,115 --> 00:53:53,618
Keep it. It's yours.

369
00:56:18,387 --> 00:56:22,433
We have found the accused,
Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson,

370
00:56:22,516 --> 00:56:25,102
guilty of the following crimes:

371
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:29,774
horse-theft, theft of supplies
belonging to the Union army...

372
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:46,040
And Shorty?

373
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:51,962
No.

374
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:55,800
No?

375
00:56:56,092 --> 00:56:59,845
..alias Shorty Larson,
to hang by the neck until dead.

376
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:03,224
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

377
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,399
Sorry, Shorty.

378
00:57:12,817 --> 00:57:15,528
Move. Come on, let's go.

379
00:57:40,136 --> 00:57:43,180
I don't know...
As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.

380
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:49,145
It burns, huh? They say people
with fair skin can't take too much.

381
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:16,338
Like that,
you won't have to carry so much.

382
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,717
Where are we going?

383
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,302
Where?

384
00:58:21,385 --> 00:58:23,846
Where I'm going, amigo.

385
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:25,723
Over that way.

386
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:29,643
Another 100 miles
of beautiful sun-baked sand.

387
00:58:29,727 --> 00:58:32,396
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

388
00:58:32,479 --> 00:58:35,065
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

389
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:38,319
Canby's men are coming here.

390
00:58:38,402 --> 00:58:42,364
But no-one will set foot in this hell.

391
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:45,159
Except you and me.

392
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:49,705
100 miles. That's a nice walk.

393
00:58:52,249 --> 00:58:55,711
What was it you told me the last time?

394
00:58:56,962 --> 00:59:01,759
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

395
00:59:02,927 --> 00:59:07,389
And if you won't manage it,
you'll die - only slowly.

396
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:12,102
Very slowly, old friend.

397
00:59:16,148 --> 00:59:17,942
After you, please.

398
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:20,110
Start walking.

399
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:06,508
(Tuco laughs)

400
01:01:15,684 --> 01:01:18,020
Taking a rest?

401
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:22,858
Come on, Blondie. We don't have
very far to go. Only 70 miles.

402
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:27,905
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

403
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:30,532
That's not too bad.

404
01:01:31,575 --> 01:01:32,910
Come on.

405
01:02:09,988 --> 01:02:12,491
(chuckles heartily)

406
01:02:16,912 --> 01:02:18,789
Whoa...

407
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,022
OK, let's eat.

408
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:29,860
That is, I'll eat.

409
01:03:31,611 --> 01:03:35,866
Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.

410
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:46,334
You want some water?

411
01:03:50,088 --> 01:03:51,840
Drink.

412
01:03:57,846 --> 01:04:00,056
Come on.

413
01:04:41,056 --> 01:04:44,434
Well, Blondie... So long.

414
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:54,129
And so, Blondie...

415
01:05:55,755 --> 01:05:58,258
it's goodbye.

416
01:05:58,341 --> 01:06:01,261
(rumble of hooves)

417
01:06:54,105 --> 01:06:56,357
Whoa, whoa...

418
01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:02,781
Easy, easy.

419
01:07:02,864 --> 01:07:05,617
Easy. Attaboy.

420
01:09:23,546 --> 01:09:25,882
(creaking)

421
01:09:34,599 --> 01:09:36,684
Water...

422
01:09:44,025 --> 01:09:49,030
200,000 in gold.
It's yours, just get me water.

423
01:09:52,867 --> 01:09:54,911
What's that you say?

424
01:09:54,994 --> 01:09:58,748
- Who the hell are you?
- Carson.

425
01:09:58,831 --> 01:10:02,251
My name is Bill Carson now.

426
01:10:02,335 --> 01:10:05,088
Surprise attack...

427
01:10:05,171 --> 01:10:09,717
AII dead...
My name is Jackson, not Carson...

428
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:13,221
Carson, yeah. Glad to meet you.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.

429
01:10:13,304 --> 01:10:19,018
- What's that you said about the dollars?
- 200,000, all mine.

430
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:22,104
It was the 3rd Cavalry's.

431
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:25,066
Baker has nothing.

432
01:10:25,149 --> 01:10:28,945
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

433
01:10:30,154 --> 01:10:33,074
Where? Here?

434
01:10:33,157 --> 01:10:37,245
- Talk.
- In... the... cemetery.

435
01:10:37,328 --> 01:10:39,038
Which cemetery?

436
01:10:39,121 --> 01:10:42,792
The one on Sad Hill.

437
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:45,127
There's a grave...

438
01:10:45,211 --> 01:10:48,256
Which grave? Have a name?

439
01:10:48,339 --> 01:10:53,135
Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk.

440
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:56,264
There's... no number.

441
01:10:56,347 --> 01:10:58,891
There's a name.

442
01:10:58,975 --> 01:11:01,477
It's written...

443
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:05,648
(croaks)

444
01:11:07,858 --> 01:11:10,778
- Water...
- (frustrated grunt)

445
01:11:11,821 --> 01:11:14,699
You talk first. I'll give you water later.

446
01:11:14,782 --> 01:11:17,910
Sad Hill cemetery. OK.
In the grave. OK.

447
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:24,083
But it must have a name or a number.
There must be 1 ,000... 5,000...

448
01:11:27,587 --> 01:11:31,632
Don't die, uh? Don't die.
I'll get you water.

449
01:11:31,716 --> 01:11:35,428
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll get you water.

450
01:11:35,511 --> 01:11:38,472
Don't die until later, you son of a...

451
01:11:59,035 --> 01:12:01,495
(yells)

452
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:06,667
Get away from there.

453
01:12:11,213 --> 01:12:13,382
He's dead.

454
01:12:16,677 --> 01:12:19,180
I'll kill you.

455
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:25,061
If you do that, you'll always be poor.

456
01:12:25,144 --> 01:12:28,272
Just like the greasy rat that you are.

457
01:12:28,814 --> 01:12:33,069
If I were you, I'd... keep me alive.

458
01:12:33,152 --> 01:12:36,280
What did he tell you?

459
01:12:36,364 --> 01:12:38,741
A name.

460
01:12:38,824 --> 01:12:43,120
- The name on a grave.
- What name?

461
01:12:56,509 --> 01:12:58,594
Blondie... Don't die.

462
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:00,763
Blondie, don't die.

463
01:13:00,846 --> 01:13:03,557
I'm your friend. Please don't die.

464
01:13:03,641 --> 01:13:06,185
I'm your friend. Come on.

465
01:13:06,268 --> 01:13:07,853
Come on, eh?

466
01:13:07,937 --> 01:13:11,398
Blondie, I'll help you. I'll help you.

467
01:13:11,482 --> 01:13:14,443
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I'll get the water.

468
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:18,405
Don't die like that pig.

469
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:20,574
Here's water, Blondie.

470
01:13:20,658 --> 01:13:24,286
Don't drink, it's no good for you.
Feel better?

471
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:28,582
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please don't die.

472
01:13:36,882 --> 01:13:40,302
(Tuco) Hey, open up! Hurry!

473
01:13:40,386 --> 01:13:43,514
Settle down. Who's there?

474
01:13:44,849 --> 01:13:49,228
What do you mean, "who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

475
01:13:51,438 --> 01:13:55,401
If I were a Yankee,
you wouldn't have time to ask me that.

476
01:13:55,484 --> 01:13:56,735
Come on.

477
01:13:56,819 --> 01:14:00,364
Sergeant, listen to
this corporal for a moment.

478
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:06,287
Sergeant, I have a gravely wounded man
here, if he's not dead already.

479
01:14:07,705 --> 01:14:11,750
- He's still alive?
- Well, he seems to be.

480
01:14:11,834 --> 01:14:13,878
- What happened?
- It was a trap.

481
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:18,799
- Only the two of us got away.
- Name and travelling papers.

482
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:23,971
Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
3rd Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,

483
01:14:24,054 --> 01:14:27,766
arriving from San Rafael.
Is that enough?

484
01:14:32,396 --> 01:14:34,857
Are you reading when this man is dying?

485
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,736
Why, Corporal, we're trying to withdraw
and you're looking for an infirmary?

486
01:14:38,819 --> 01:14:42,948
If you want one, you'll have
to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

487
01:14:43,616 --> 01:14:47,202
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.

488
01:14:48,537 --> 01:14:50,998
Apache Canyon?

489
01:14:51,081 --> 01:14:53,584
Is a mission San Antonio around here?

490
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:55,836
18 miles south. Take him there.

491
01:14:55,919 --> 01:14:59,590
The brothers take care of any wounded,
whatever the colour of his uniform.

492
01:14:59,673 --> 01:15:02,676
And keep your eyes open -
the area is full of Yankees.

493
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,345
Thank you.
Goodbye, Sergeant.

494
01:15:04,428 --> 01:15:06,430
Take care.

495
01:15:25,115 --> 01:15:27,201
Whoa!

496
01:15:30,245 --> 01:15:33,499
- Got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds.

497
01:15:33,582 --> 01:15:36,085
Let him have yours.

498
01:15:41,006 --> 01:15:45,135
- Where's Padre Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez is away at the moment.

499
01:15:45,219 --> 01:15:47,638
He should be back any day now.

500
01:15:47,721 --> 01:15:51,892
It doesn't matter. For the moment,
we take very good care of my friend.

501
01:15:51,975 --> 01:15:53,811
And may God be praised.

502
01:15:53,894 --> 01:15:59,483
God is on our side too, because
he hates the Yankees. Huh, Blondie?

503
01:16:00,859 --> 01:16:04,822
- Father, is he still breathing?
- Yes, of course.

504
01:16:04,905 --> 01:16:06,990
You're heavy.

505
01:16:17,793 --> 01:16:19,878
There.

506
01:16:48,615 --> 01:16:51,743
AII right. Put a fresh bandage on him.

507
01:16:52,703 --> 01:16:55,497
Put him in my cell.

508
01:16:55,581 --> 01:16:57,666
Easy.

509
01:17:00,043 --> 01:17:02,379
Out, soldier. Out you go.

510
01:17:02,462 --> 01:17:06,300
Look after him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

511
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:12,931
Hey, Father, l...

512
01:17:20,397 --> 01:17:22,566
(mutters)

513
01:17:25,694 --> 01:17:29,448
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

514
01:17:58,352 --> 01:18:01,313
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything?

515
01:18:01,396 --> 01:18:03,148
No, he hasn't spoken as yet.

516
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:08,445
But don't worry, he's young and strong -
that's what's kept him going.

517
01:18:08,528 --> 01:18:10,864
He should regain his strength
in a short time.

518
01:18:10,947 --> 01:18:13,659
Thank you. You don't know
what this boy's life means to me.

519
01:18:13,742 --> 01:18:16,370
Thanks be to Jesus.

520
01:19:05,168 --> 01:19:06,461
Blondie?

521
01:19:12,008 --> 01:19:15,137
Hey, Blondie?

522
01:19:33,321 --> 01:19:37,701
The old Father tells me
you'll be up and around in a few days.

523
01:19:37,784 --> 01:19:41,621
You were very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

524
01:19:41,705 --> 01:19:45,292
Think if you'd been on your own.

525
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:50,755
Look, I mean when one is... ill,

526
01:19:50,839 --> 01:19:56,052
it's good to have somebody close by,
friends or relations.

527
01:19:56,136 --> 01:20:01,808
Do you... you have parents, Blondie?
A mother?

528
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:04,811
Not even a mother.

529
01:20:05,353 --> 01:20:07,439
No-one?

530
01:20:07,522 --> 01:20:10,984
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

531
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:13,820
We're all alone in the world.

532
01:20:13,904 --> 01:20:17,032
I have you, you have me.

533
01:20:18,742 --> 01:20:21,244
Only for a little while, I mean.

534
01:20:21,328 --> 01:20:26,583
It had to happen now.
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.

535
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:30,712
We could have all that money
in our hands.

536
01:20:34,799 --> 01:20:41,306
I... I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
In my place, you would do the same thing.

537
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:46,186
It's all over for you now.

538
01:20:46,269 --> 01:20:50,148
There's nothing anyone can do any more.

539
01:20:51,566 --> 01:20:53,526
Oh, God, forgive me.

540
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:56,738
It's my fault, mine, mine, mine, mine!

541
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:09,876
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

542
01:21:09,959 --> 01:21:13,588
If I knew that my last hour had come,
I swear,

543
01:21:13,672 --> 01:21:17,926
in my place...
in your place I would do the same thing.

544
01:21:18,009 --> 01:21:21,554
I would tell about the gold.
Yes, yes, I would.

545
01:21:21,638 --> 01:21:23,973
I would tell the name on the grave.

546
01:21:24,057 --> 01:21:28,645
What good is the money if you're dead?
I know the name of the cemetery.

547
01:21:28,728 --> 01:21:31,940
But you know how many graves
there are there?

548
01:21:32,023 --> 01:21:37,904
Please. Blondie, please.
Have a little...

549
01:21:40,865 --> 01:21:44,244
Coffee?
Please, tell me the name.

550
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:46,913
On... on the grave.

551
01:21:48,289 --> 01:21:52,752
If I get my hands on the 200,000 dollars,

552
01:21:52,836 --> 01:21:55,839
I'll always honour your memory.

553
01:21:55,922 --> 01:22:00,218
I swear, I'll always honour your memory.

554
01:22:02,178 --> 01:22:04,139
Come closer.

555
01:22:09,018 --> 01:22:11,104
Tell me.

556
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,941
You dirty...

557
01:22:16,651 --> 01:22:19,237
I'll sleep better...

558
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:23,783
knowing my good friend is by my side...

559
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:26,244
to protect me.

560
01:22:35,003 --> 01:22:37,338
"Tuco, water." Well, here's water.

561
01:22:37,422 --> 01:22:42,093
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water! I'll give you...

562
01:22:48,141 --> 01:22:50,977
AII right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

563
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:54,856
Come on. The party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.

564
01:22:54,939 --> 01:23:00,320
We'd better get the hell out of here,
before we get caught up in the war.

565
01:23:00,403 --> 01:23:03,448
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

566
01:23:03,531 --> 01:23:08,411
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

567
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:11,080
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

568
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,974
Hey, Pablo?

569
01:23:36,648 --> 01:23:39,275
Don't you recognise me?

570
01:23:40,818 --> 01:23:43,321
It's me. Tuco.

571
01:23:43,404 --> 01:23:46,532
Let me embrace you...

572
01:23:48,534 --> 01:23:51,746
I don't know the right thing.

573
01:23:55,917 --> 01:24:02,173
I was passing by and said to myself
"I wonder if my brother remembers me?"

574
01:24:04,717 --> 01:24:07,053
Did I do wrong?

575
01:24:07,553 --> 01:24:10,056
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

576
01:24:10,139 --> 01:24:12,392
You have seen me, Tuco.

577
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:17,271
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

578
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,946
Ah, my uniform.

579
01:24:25,029 --> 01:24:27,115
It's a long story.

580
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,618
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.

581
01:24:30,702 --> 01:24:35,373
You look very well.
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

582
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:40,837
You were always thin, eh, Pablito?

583
01:24:41,754 --> 01:24:44,799
Wh... What about our parents?

584
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:52,140
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.

585
01:24:54,058 --> 01:24:56,936
Nine years?

586
01:24:57,019 --> 01:24:59,731
So it's nine years.

587
01:24:59,814 --> 01:25:01,399
Nine years.

588
01:25:02,066 --> 01:25:04,902
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

589
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,868
Our father died only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.

590
01:25:13,411 --> 01:25:15,913
He asked for you to be there.

591
01:25:15,997 --> 01:25:19,125
But there was only me.

592
01:25:25,006 --> 01:25:27,175
And you?

593
01:25:27,258 --> 01:25:31,471
Outside of evil,
what else have you managed to do?

594
01:25:31,554 --> 01:25:36,392
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

595
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:39,729
Not one. Lots of them.

596
01:25:39,812 --> 01:25:43,608
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

597
01:25:43,691 --> 01:25:48,112
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

598
01:25:48,196 --> 01:25:51,532
What good would that be?

599
01:25:51,616 --> 01:25:54,285
Just keep on the way you're going.

600
01:25:54,368 --> 01:25:56,787
Go away.

601
01:25:56,871 --> 01:25:59,457
- The Lord have mercy on your soul.
- Sure, I'll go.

602
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:02,335
While I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me!

603
01:26:02,418 --> 01:26:07,715
I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother
Ramirez, will tell you something.

604
01:26:07,798 --> 01:26:10,218
You think you're better than I am.

605
01:26:10,301 --> 01:26:15,223
Where we came from,
one became a priest or a bandit.

606
01:26:15,306 --> 01:26:19,685
You chose your way, I chose mine.
Mine was harder.

607
01:26:19,769 --> 01:26:22,063
You talk of our mother and father -

608
01:26:22,146 --> 01:26:24,815
when you left to become a priest,
I stayed behind.

609
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:29,028
I must have been 10, 12,
I don't remember. But I stayed.

610
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:33,241
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I'll tell you something.

611
01:26:33,324 --> 01:26:39,330
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

612
01:26:56,764 --> 01:26:58,432
Tuco.

613
01:27:08,943 --> 01:27:11,195
Please forgive me, brother.

614
01:27:22,456 --> 01:27:24,375
Haa!

615
01:27:40,224 --> 01:27:44,145
Ah, my belly's full.

616
01:27:44,228 --> 01:27:46,480
Nice guy, my brother.

617
01:27:46,564 --> 01:27:49,108
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here?

618
01:27:49,191 --> 01:27:53,571
Everything. Like the Pope, almost.
He's in charge in Rome.

619
01:27:53,654 --> 01:27:58,909
My brother, he say to me
"Stay, brother, we never see each other."

620
01:27:58,993 --> 01:28:02,913
"There's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too."

621
01:28:02,997 --> 01:28:07,168
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

622
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:11,338
My brother, he's crazy about me.

623
01:28:14,842 --> 01:28:19,930
That's so. Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens,

624
01:28:20,014 --> 01:28:25,102
I know there's a brother somewhere
who'll never refuse me a bowl of soup.

625
01:28:26,645 --> 01:28:29,315
Sure.

626
01:28:29,398 --> 01:28:34,195
Well, after a meal
there's nothing like a good cigar.

627
01:29:23,994 --> 01:29:27,164
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

628
01:29:27,248 --> 01:29:30,459
Going this way, we cross the Rio Grande.

629
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:33,587
That sure is a long way.

630
01:29:33,671 --> 01:29:37,800
Here to the northwest,
through all of Texas...

631
01:29:37,883 --> 01:29:40,052
- After that...
- Then what?

632
01:29:42,137 --> 01:29:46,934
When we get there, I'll tell you.
You're not worried, are you?

633
01:29:48,978 --> 01:29:53,357
Those men aren't worried
about anything any more, are they?

634
01:29:55,192 --> 01:30:01,448
But since I'm alive and I've noticed
we'll be crossing enemy lines a few times,

635
01:30:01,532 --> 01:30:04,785
I thought you might tell me
where we're going.

636
01:30:04,868 --> 01:30:08,956
Towards 200,000 dollars.
Is that good enough for you?

637
01:30:17,798 --> 01:30:19,883
Whoa.

638
01:30:20,551 --> 01:30:22,720
(growls)

639
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:30,227
Wake up, you.

640
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:33,772
- There are troops coming.
- Blue or grey?

641
01:30:40,195 --> 01:30:43,907
They're grey, like us.
Let's say hello to them, then get going.

642
01:30:43,991 --> 01:30:47,870
Hurrah! Hurrah for the Confederacy!

643
01:30:47,953 --> 01:30:51,331
Hurrah! Down with General Grant!

644
01:30:51,415 --> 01:30:53,250
Hurrah for General...

645
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:55,044
- What's his name?
- Lee.

646
01:30:55,127 --> 01:30:56,628
..Lee!

647
01:30:57,004 --> 01:31:02,092
God is with us because
he hates the Yanks, too! Hurrah!

648
01:31:02,176 --> 01:31:05,929
God's not on our side,
cos he hates idiots also.

649
01:31:18,192 --> 01:31:22,279
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

650
01:31:22,362 --> 01:31:26,074
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three four...

651
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:29,411
Prisoners of war, forward...

652
01:31:30,537 --> 01:31:32,289
march.

653
01:31:32,372 --> 01:31:35,542
Hup, two, three, four...

654
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:31,348
Left face.

655
01:32:34,184 --> 01:32:38,730
Form a single file. Move.

656
01:33:08,844 --> 01:33:12,055
(corporal takes prisoner roll call)

657
01:33:19,604 --> 01:33:22,983
- Jonathan Broad.
- Present.

658
01:33:29,114 --> 01:33:31,825
- Richard Mobiley.
- Present.

659
01:33:31,908 --> 01:33:35,829
- Nathaniel Sullivan.
- Present.

660
01:33:36,288 --> 01:33:39,416
- Robert Clark.
- Present.

661
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:42,919
- Sam Richmond.
- Present.

662
01:33:46,089 --> 01:33:48,175
Bill Carson.

663
01:33:50,886 --> 01:33:53,388
Bill Carson?

664
01:33:53,847 --> 01:33:56,308
I said Bill Carson.

665
01:33:56,391 --> 01:33:59,186
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

666
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:06,068
AII right, what's he doing, sleeping?
Bill Carson!

667
01:34:06,151 --> 01:34:09,029
Yeah. You better be Bill Carson.

668
01:34:09,112 --> 01:34:10,781
Bill Carson!

669
01:34:10,864 --> 01:34:13,992
Yeah, yeah... That's me.

670
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,211
Please, Carson...

671
01:34:25,253 --> 01:34:27,339
answer "present".

672
01:34:28,715 --> 01:34:31,510
What, are you deaf?

673
01:34:36,389 --> 01:34:38,892
Now suppose you say "present", Carson.

674
01:34:40,936 --> 01:34:46,024
I like big fat men like you -
when they fall, they make more noise.

675
01:34:46,107 --> 01:34:49,194
And sometimes they never get up.

676
01:34:49,986 --> 01:34:51,446
Wallace.

677
01:34:52,948 --> 01:34:54,699
That's enough.

678
01:34:57,577 --> 01:34:58,829
Sergeant.

679
01:35:00,956 --> 01:35:05,126
The captain wants to see you right away.

680
01:35:06,878 --> 01:35:10,423
Be sure these two get good treatment.

681
01:35:19,432 --> 01:35:23,395
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.

682
01:35:25,689 --> 01:35:27,774
Yeah.

683
01:35:30,235 --> 01:35:33,780
For the last time, Sergeant,
I'm telling you,

684
01:35:33,863 --> 01:35:37,784
I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.

685
01:35:37,867 --> 01:35:40,829
No more brutality.

686
01:35:40,912 --> 01:35:44,624
There's hundreds of prisoners
and only a few men to guard 'em.

687
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:46,793
I have to have respect.

688
01:35:46,876 --> 01:35:51,881
I think you'll manage to gain their respect
by treating them better.

689
01:35:53,174 --> 01:35:55,760
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

690
01:35:55,844 --> 01:35:58,722
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville.

691
01:35:58,805 --> 01:36:05,478
While I'm in charge, the prisoners are not
to be tortured or cheated... or murdered.

692
01:36:06,187 --> 01:36:07,981
That an accusation?

693
01:36:08,064 --> 01:36:13,278
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

694
01:36:13,778 --> 01:36:17,282
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed systematically.

695
01:36:17,365 --> 01:36:20,535
I know there's scum around,
bivouacked near the camp,

696
01:36:20,618 --> 01:36:23,830
waiting for someone to deliver this loot.

697
01:36:23,913 --> 01:36:28,918
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

698
01:36:31,212 --> 01:36:32,756
Yes, sir.

699
01:36:32,839 --> 01:36:35,216
Just as long as you're the commandant.

700
01:36:36,885 --> 01:36:38,970
Yes, Sergeant.

701
01:36:41,097 --> 01:36:44,851
I know this leg means
I won't last very long,

702
01:36:44,934 --> 01:36:51,608
but I pray I have enough time to amass
evidence and bring to a court martial

703
01:36:51,691 --> 01:36:57,739
all those who discredit and dishonour
the uniform of the Union.

704
01:37:01,993 --> 01:37:04,704
I wish you luck.

705
01:37:38,404 --> 01:37:42,742
You and the others
better lay low for a few days.

706
01:37:42,826 --> 01:37:47,080
I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

707
01:37:56,923 --> 01:38:01,469
- Wallace, bring me Carson.
- Right.

708
01:38:14,941 --> 01:38:19,028
Angel Eyes said for us
to lay low for a few days.

709
01:38:19,112 --> 01:38:24,409
We'll keep close enough to keep
an eye on things. Saddle your horses.

710
01:38:24,909 --> 01:38:26,995
Get in.

711
01:38:30,582 --> 01:38:32,750
(door is locked)

712
01:38:35,044 --> 01:38:38,256
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.

713
01:38:39,549 --> 01:38:42,677
There's no formalities here.

714
01:38:53,104 --> 01:38:55,732
It's been a long time.

715
01:38:55,815 --> 01:38:58,651
(Tuco's stomach rumbles)

716
01:38:58,735 --> 01:39:00,945
You're hungry.

717
01:39:01,029 --> 01:39:03,740
Sit down. Eat.

718
01:39:22,175 --> 01:39:25,637
I knew it, I knew it!

719
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:31,851
The minute I saw you, I said to myself
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes."

720
01:39:32,852 --> 01:39:36,314
"I bet he got himself an easy job."

721
01:39:38,733 --> 01:39:41,444
"And he never forgets a friend."

722
01:39:41,527 --> 01:39:44,655
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

723
01:39:46,074 --> 01:39:47,658
Right.

724
01:39:47,742 --> 01:39:51,079
It's good to see old friends again.

725
01:39:51,162 --> 01:39:52,705
Good.

726
01:39:52,789 --> 01:39:56,209
Especially when they've come
from so far away.

727
01:39:56,292 --> 01:39:59,837
And have so much to talk about.

728
01:39:59,921 --> 01:40:03,299
And you do have a lot to talk about,
haven't you?

729
01:40:05,593 --> 01:40:09,389
You were captured near Fort Craig?

730
01:40:13,559 --> 01:40:20,066
If you were with Sibley, that means
you were coming from Santa Fe.

731
01:40:31,452 --> 01:40:36,999
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Mm-hm. Very hard.

732
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:40,294
Especially if you don't have
anything to drink.

733
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:48,219
Why are you going under
the name of Bill Carson now?

734
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:53,683
One name is as good as another.

735
01:40:53,766 --> 01:40:56,686
Not wise to use your own name.

736
01:40:56,769 --> 01:41:01,149
Like you.
I bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.

737
01:41:01,232 --> 01:41:04,193
Sergeant Angel Eyes!

738
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:15,246
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?

739
01:41:15,329 --> 01:41:21,335
Music? Yes, it's very good.
Very good for the digestion.

740
01:41:33,097 --> 01:41:35,391
So...

741
01:41:35,474 --> 01:41:39,520
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

742
01:41:43,482 --> 01:41:46,819
That fake, too?

743
01:41:46,903 --> 01:41:51,115
Bill Carson's name's written on it.

744
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:56,037
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

745
01:41:58,456 --> 01:42:00,333
Aarh!

746
01:42:01,167 --> 01:42:04,170
(mournful tune)

747
01:43:18,911 --> 01:43:23,332
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

748
01:43:28,254 --> 01:43:30,548
What did he tell you about the money?

749
01:43:30,631 --> 01:43:33,259
I don't...

750
01:43:33,342 --> 01:43:36,053
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

751
01:43:54,446 --> 01:43:56,365
More feeling.

752
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,470
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

753
01:44:18,554 --> 01:44:21,515
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

754
01:44:21,599 --> 01:44:25,144
So many of us
have had a session in there.

755
01:44:45,748 --> 01:44:49,168
How's your digestion now?

756
01:44:51,879 --> 01:44:57,259
- You'd better talk.
- I have nothing to tell you.

757
01:45:23,619 --> 01:45:26,330
Play that fiddle, you.

758
01:46:01,615 --> 01:46:04,076
(screams)

759
01:46:09,915 --> 01:46:12,126
I'll talk... I'll talk...

760
01:46:21,593 --> 01:46:24,388
What did he say about the money?

761
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:27,933
It's bu...

762
01:46:28,016 --> 01:46:31,520
It's buried in a grave.

763
01:46:31,603 --> 01:46:33,313
Where?

764
01:46:33,397 --> 01:46:34,815
Sad Hill...

765
01:46:34,898 --> 01:46:37,401
Sad Hill cemetery.

766
01:46:40,112 --> 01:46:42,072
Which grave?

767
01:46:42,156 --> 01:46:46,076
I don't know.
I don't know, I tell you.

768
01:46:47,703 --> 01:46:49,663
Blondie...

769
01:46:49,746 --> 01:46:54,543
Ask Blondie.
He knows the name of the grave.

770
01:47:11,226 --> 01:47:14,354
The war's over for you.

771
01:47:16,315 --> 01:47:19,443
Put those clothes on.

772
01:47:22,654 --> 01:47:24,406
Why?

773
01:47:24,489 --> 01:47:27,451
We're going for a ride.

774
01:47:27,534 --> 01:47:31,538
- Where?
- To find 200,000 dollars.

775
01:47:31,622 --> 01:47:34,833
I know the name of the cemetery now.

776
01:47:34,917 --> 01:47:38,420
And you know the name of the grave.

777
01:47:57,481 --> 01:48:00,609
You're not going to give me
the same treatment?

778
01:48:04,029 --> 01:48:05,989
Would you talk?

779
01:48:06,823 --> 01:48:08,575
No. Probably not.

780
01:48:10,327 --> 01:48:12,913
That's what I thought.

781
01:48:12,996 --> 01:48:15,374
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco,

782
01:48:15,457 --> 01:48:18,835
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

783
01:48:22,547 --> 01:48:25,759
And Tuco? Is he...

784
01:48:27,844 --> 01:48:30,931
No. Not yet.

785
01:48:31,014 --> 01:48:33,600
But he's in very good hands.

786
01:48:34,309 --> 01:48:37,813
You've changed partners,
but you've still got the same deal.

787
01:48:37,896 --> 01:48:40,440
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

788
01:48:41,775 --> 01:48:45,737
There's two of us.
Should make it easier than just one.

789
01:48:50,575 --> 01:48:52,661
Yeah.

790
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:13,390
Hold it.

791
01:49:13,473 --> 01:49:16,268
That's it. Don't move.

792
01:49:16,351 --> 01:49:21,898
Now, don't breathe. Still... that's it.

793
01:49:21,982 --> 01:49:25,277
Got it. Thank you.

794
01:49:39,875 --> 01:49:43,628
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?

795
01:49:43,712 --> 01:49:47,340
To hell, with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

796
01:49:47,424 --> 01:49:52,554
3,000 dollars, friend.
That's a lot of money for a head.

797
01:49:52,637 --> 01:49:56,391
I'll bet they didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

798
01:50:01,521 --> 01:50:03,273
I told you once, friend.

799
01:50:03,356 --> 01:50:08,195
If I ever get you down, you're gonna
need a lot of help to get up again.

800
01:50:28,131 --> 01:50:30,342
You're a lot luckier than that one.

801
01:50:30,425 --> 01:50:33,011
You get some grub, a rope,
and you're finished.

802
01:50:33,094 --> 01:50:36,973
And there isn't any partner this time
to shoot you down.

803
01:52:04,644 --> 01:52:07,313
(rustling)

804
01:52:18,074 --> 01:52:23,079
If your friends stay out in the damp,
they're liable to catch a cold, aren't they?

805
01:52:23,163 --> 01:52:25,540
Or a bullet.

806
01:52:29,669 --> 01:52:33,047
Hear that, boys?
Come on out here.

807
01:52:44,267 --> 01:52:49,189
Since we're all going in the same
direction, might as well go together.

808
01:52:49,272 --> 01:52:51,733
One, two,

809
01:52:51,816 --> 01:52:53,860
three, four,

810
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:56,738
five, six.

811
01:52:57,197 --> 01:53:00,366
Six... Perfect number.

812
01:53:01,659 --> 01:53:04,621
Isn't three the perfect number?

813
01:53:05,747 --> 01:53:10,210
Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.

814
01:53:11,794 --> 01:53:13,880
(chuckles)

815
01:53:16,633 --> 01:53:18,927
(train whistle)

816
01:54:12,605 --> 01:54:17,277
Sure would like to
put your paw on it, huh?

817
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:22,073
I would like to piss. It's rough.
I've been on this train nearly ten hours.

818
01:54:22,156 --> 01:54:24,951
You smell like a pig already.

819
01:54:25,034 --> 01:54:27,870
Let's try not to make things any worse.

820
01:54:30,164 --> 01:54:32,250
Get going.

821
01:54:40,466 --> 01:54:44,137
I can't while you're watching me.

822
01:54:55,148 --> 01:54:57,108
Aaaarh!

823
01:55:06,576 --> 01:55:10,329
You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?

824
01:55:30,641 --> 01:55:34,604
You don't want to break our friendship?
Well, I'll break it.

825
01:55:59,212 --> 01:56:01,798
(train approaching)

826
01:57:18,749 --> 01:57:21,585
Squad, halt.

827
01:57:21,669 --> 01:57:24,547
Take your places.

828
01:57:34,724 --> 01:57:36,642
Ready.

829
01:57:36,726 --> 01:57:38,227
Aim.

830
01:57:38,311 --> 01:57:40,396
Fire.

831
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:59,415
Clem, take care of the horses.

832
01:58:02,626 --> 01:58:05,129
(cannon fire)

833
01:58:21,937 --> 01:58:24,690
(whistle of cannonball)

834
02:01:30,459 --> 02:01:32,628
(splash of water)

835
02:01:45,974 --> 02:01:49,186
(Tuco sings quietly to himself)

836
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:18,423
I've been looking for you for eight months.

837
02:02:18,507 --> 02:02:23,095
Whenever I should have had a gun
in my right hand, I thought of you.

838
02:02:23,178 --> 02:02:27,140
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

839
02:02:27,224 --> 02:02:33,063
And I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

840
02:02:47,035 --> 02:02:51,665
When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.

841
02:02:53,292 --> 02:02:56,378
Every gun makes its own tune.

842
02:02:56,461 --> 02:02:59,923
It's perfect timing, large one.

843
02:03:16,773 --> 02:03:19,318
Clem, follow him.

844
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:54,936
(tsks)

845
02:04:05,238 --> 02:04:08,617
(banging on door)

846
02:04:16,375 --> 02:04:19,378
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

847
02:04:19,461 --> 02:04:23,215
Just give me time to get dressed
and I'll open up.

848
02:04:40,315 --> 02:04:42,192
(gun cocks)

849
02:04:43,443 --> 02:04:46,988
Put your drawers on
and take your gun off.

850
02:04:55,330 --> 02:04:57,124
Hey...

851
02:04:57,207 --> 02:05:01,878
Hey, Blondie, how the hell
did you get out of that pigsty?

852
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:07,801
My own way.
I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.

853
02:05:08,301 --> 02:05:11,721
You talked, you traitor. You talked.

854
02:05:12,347 --> 02:05:17,102
No, I didn't talk.
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.

855
02:05:18,395 --> 02:05:21,022
You... me...

856
02:05:21,148 --> 02:05:23,984
So only you know your half of the secret?

857
02:05:24,734 --> 02:05:26,278
Mm-hm.

858
02:05:27,404 --> 02:05:31,032
Ah, Blondie...

859
02:05:31,116 --> 02:05:35,495
I'm very happy you're working with me,
and we're together again.

860
02:05:35,579 --> 02:05:39,166
- I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.
- Oh, listen...

861
02:05:39,249 --> 02:05:43,295
I forgot to mention.

862
02:05:43,378 --> 02:05:48,133
He's not alone.
There's five of them.

863
02:05:48,216 --> 02:05:51,595
- Five?
- Yeah. Five of them.

864
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:57,642
So that's why you came to Tuco.

865
02:05:59,728 --> 02:06:02,439
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.

866
02:06:14,075 --> 02:06:17,287
They shot him at close range.

867
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:19,664
(whistle of cannonball)

868
02:06:35,764 --> 02:06:40,727
- Well, look who's here.
- The other one will be along.

869
02:06:42,729 --> 02:06:46,316
They'll come looking for us.

870
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:48,610
Watch out.

871
02:06:48,693 --> 02:06:51,738
There's two of them.

872
02:06:51,821 --> 02:06:54,074
I want that blond alive.

873
02:07:02,916 --> 02:07:06,628
You, back there.
Come on, let's go.

874
02:07:40,286 --> 02:07:42,622
Were you going to die alone?

875
02:08:57,488 --> 02:09:00,408
(whistle of cannonball)

876
02:09:07,707 --> 02:09:09,792
(coughing)

877
02:09:28,645 --> 02:09:29,729
(whistles)

878
02:09:32,982 --> 02:09:34,275
Ho!

879
02:09:48,581 --> 02:09:50,166
(noise above)

880
02:09:59,342 --> 02:10:02,428
Hey, Blondie. Angel Eyes is mine.

881
02:10:02,512 --> 02:10:04,097
AII right.

882
02:10:43,428 --> 02:10:48,224
"See you soon, l... idi.."

883
02:10:48,307 --> 02:10:50,893
"Idiots."

884
02:10:50,977 --> 02:10:53,271
It's for you.

885
02:11:17,503 --> 02:11:20,465
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

886
02:11:20,548 --> 02:11:24,218
Like a cemetery, for instance?

887
02:11:24,302 --> 02:11:27,221
There should be a bridge
across that river.

888
02:11:27,305 --> 02:11:32,935
- We better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me, Blondie.

889
02:11:33,019 --> 02:11:35,771
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

890
02:11:35,855 --> 02:11:39,901
Tuco has taken you this far,
I will take you all the way to...

891
02:11:44,947 --> 02:11:48,034
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

892
02:11:48,117 --> 02:11:51,454
Come along, now. Follow me.

893
02:12:37,124 --> 02:12:40,670
We found them near the perimeter, sir.

894
02:12:54,141 --> 02:12:56,352
Where do you hail from?

895
02:12:56,435 --> 02:12:57,853
IIlinois.

896
02:13:00,272 --> 02:13:02,149
And you?

897
02:13:02,233 --> 02:13:04,110
I'm with him.

898
02:13:10,074 --> 02:13:13,452
Any reason for being around here?

899
02:13:13,536 --> 02:13:16,497
We want to enlist, General.

900
02:13:19,041 --> 02:13:21,377
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.

901
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:23,546
I'm a captain.

902
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:27,675
Get the hell out.

903
02:13:27,758 --> 02:13:30,761
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

904
02:13:30,845 --> 02:13:32,930
Yes, sir.

905
02:13:37,727 --> 02:13:39,979
So you want to enlist?

906
02:13:40,896 --> 02:13:44,650
You've got to take a test to prove it.

907
02:13:52,616 --> 02:13:55,119
Well, show me.

908
02:14:13,053 --> 02:14:16,140
Hey... (chuckles)

909
02:14:17,892 --> 02:14:22,313
You've got a career.
At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel.

910
02:14:22,396 --> 02:14:25,191
- Really?
- Sure.

911
02:14:25,274 --> 02:14:27,401
Like it says in the manual,

912
02:14:27,485 --> 02:14:32,865
you've got every qualification to become
an expert in the use of weapons.

913
02:14:32,948 --> 02:14:38,078
For this, sir, is the most
potent weapon in war. (exhales)

914
02:14:39,830 --> 02:14:43,459
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.

915
02:14:44,585 --> 02:14:46,670
Volunteers.

916
02:14:48,130 --> 02:14:52,593
You want to enlist, hm? Let's go.

917
02:14:52,676 --> 02:14:55,804
Come on, gentlemen, come on.

918
02:14:57,264 --> 02:15:00,726
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're in time.

919
02:15:09,193 --> 02:15:10,736
Eh?

920
02:15:16,408 --> 02:15:19,328
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

921
02:15:19,411 --> 02:15:23,457
and send them to be slaughtered...
is the winner.

922
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:29,964
We and the ones over on the other side of
the river only have one thing in common.

923
02:15:30,047 --> 02:15:32,424
AII of us reek of alcohol.

924
02:15:40,224 --> 02:15:42,893
What did you say your name was?

925
02:15:42,977 --> 02:15:44,311
Uh...

926
02:15:45,145 --> 02:15:47,273
And you?

927
02:15:48,065 --> 02:15:49,149
Uh...

928
02:15:49,233 --> 02:15:51,235
"Uh." No.

929
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:58,951
Names don't matter.

930
02:15:59,034 --> 02:16:04,623
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.

931
02:16:04,707 --> 02:16:07,001
We have two attacks a day.

932
02:16:07,084 --> 02:16:09,753
- Two attacks a day?
- Sure.

933
02:16:09,837 --> 02:16:15,009
The rebs have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area.

934
02:16:15,092 --> 02:16:18,220
Stupid, useless bridge.

935
02:16:18,303 --> 02:16:21,557
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

936
02:16:22,599 --> 02:16:28,105
Headquarters has declared
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck.

937
02:16:29,148 --> 02:16:31,316
Even if all of us are killed.

938
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:36,989
Otherwise the key'll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

939
02:16:37,072 --> 02:16:41,785
And that's not all.
Both sides want the bridge intact.

940
02:16:41,869 --> 02:16:47,124
Intact is how the South wants it,
and we want it intact, too.

941
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:53,297
You'll all turn to dust,
but one thing is sure, boys:

942
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:57,760
Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.

943
02:16:57,843 --> 02:17:03,056
Is it bad
to speak the way I do to volunteers?

944
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:06,435
I've done a lot worse.

945
02:17:09,605 --> 02:17:14,109
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!

946
02:17:14,193 --> 02:17:17,404
In here, I've destroyed it all.

947
02:17:18,363 --> 02:17:23,577
It's a court-martial offence to dream
of blowing it up. A serious crime.

948
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:29,291
Even to think of
destroying that bridge is just...

949
02:17:30,751 --> 02:17:33,003
Why not really blow it up, Captain?

950
02:17:34,671 --> 02:17:38,050
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.

951
02:17:38,133 --> 02:17:40,469
(laughs)

952
02:17:41,470 --> 02:17:44,598
I've been dreaming about it.

953
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:50,562
I've even worked out a plan.

954
02:17:50,646 --> 02:17:52,648
I sure have.

955
02:17:53,565 --> 02:17:56,860
The best time is after the attack,

956
02:17:56,944 --> 02:18:00,822
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

957
02:18:00,906 --> 02:18:05,911
If I could do it,
I could save many thousands of men.

958
02:18:05,994 --> 02:18:08,288
(soldiers shout)

959
02:18:10,874 --> 02:18:14,002
But what I lack is the guts.

960
02:18:19,216 --> 02:18:22,469
They're beginning
the daily slaughter right on time.

961
02:18:22,553 --> 02:18:25,931
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

962
02:18:26,014 --> 02:18:28,725
Be right there.

963
02:18:41,238 --> 02:18:43,365
Let's go.

964
02:18:43,448 --> 02:18:45,367
AII right, friends.

965
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:48,704
Come along and enjoy the spectacle.

966
02:19:08,765 --> 02:19:11,560
(bugle call)

967
02:19:19,026 --> 02:19:21,528
Companies, report.

968
02:19:21,611 --> 02:19:24,406
Company B ready.

969
02:19:24,489 --> 02:19:27,284
Company E ready.

970
02:19:27,367 --> 02:19:30,495
Company D ready.

971
02:19:35,375 --> 02:19:39,129
Companies, forward!

972
02:19:39,212 --> 02:19:41,465
(battle cries)

973
02:20:00,067 --> 02:20:04,029
Hey, Blondie. Looks like the captain
is asking for a bullet in his guts.

974
02:20:04,112 --> 02:20:06,198
Yeah.

975
02:20:58,458 --> 02:21:02,837
I've never seen so many men
wasted so badly.

976
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:26,820
I have a feeling it's really
going to be a good, long battle.

977
02:21:30,115 --> 02:21:32,325
Blondie...

978
02:21:32,409 --> 02:21:35,036
The money's on the other side of the river.

979
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:38,039
Oh? Where?

980
02:21:40,375 --> 02:21:44,296
Amigo, I said the other side,
and that's enough.

981
02:21:44,379 --> 02:21:48,925
But while the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

982
02:21:49,009 --> 02:21:54,139
What would happen if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?

983
02:21:54,222 --> 02:22:00,228
Yeah. Then these idiots
would go somewhere else to fight.

984
02:22:00,312 --> 02:22:02,397
Maybe.

985
02:22:39,559 --> 02:22:43,563
Get a doctor, quick!
The captain's wounded!

986
02:22:44,856 --> 02:22:47,734
Hurry, a stretcher.

987
02:22:48,818 --> 02:22:51,654
Easy. Easy now.

988
02:22:55,533 --> 02:22:56,951
Arh!

989
02:23:01,581 --> 02:23:04,292
Get things ready.

990
02:23:24,145 --> 02:23:26,981
A little of this will help.

991
02:23:32,570 --> 02:23:35,031
Take a slug of this, Captain.

992
02:23:35,114 --> 02:23:37,116
And keep your ears open.

993
02:24:23,705 --> 02:24:25,707
(grunting)

994
02:24:25,790 --> 02:24:29,627
(man) What are you doing?
No... Leave me alone...

995
02:26:08,017 --> 02:26:12,105
Blondie, hey.
You realise we might be risking our lives?

996
02:26:12,647 --> 02:26:18,402
Yeah. And if I get killed, you'll never get
your hands on all that beautiful money.

997
02:26:18,486 --> 02:26:20,321
Yeah, Tuco.

998
02:26:21,239 --> 02:26:23,574
Sure would be a pity.

999
02:26:53,479 --> 02:26:54,647
Doc...

1000
02:26:56,899 --> 02:27:01,696
Doctor... Can you help me
Iive a little longer?

1001
02:27:01,779 --> 02:27:04,740
I expect good news.

1002
02:27:17,003 --> 02:27:18,546
(gasps)

1003
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:53,372
Eh... Eh...

1004
02:27:54,749 --> 02:27:57,877
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

1005
02:27:57,960 --> 02:28:00,463
Why don't we?

1006
02:28:01,505 --> 02:28:03,549
You go first.

1007
02:28:05,301 --> 02:28:10,139
No, I think it's better that...

1008
02:28:10,222 --> 02:28:12,600
you start.

1009
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:18,481
AII right.

1010
02:28:19,315 --> 02:28:23,903
The name of the cemetery is...

1011
02:28:39,794 --> 02:28:42,004
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

1012
02:28:50,262 --> 02:28:53,057
The name on the grave is...

1013
02:28:56,519 --> 02:28:58,562
Arch Stanton.

1014
02:28:58,646 --> 02:29:02,149
Ar... Arch Stanton?

1015
02:29:02,233 --> 02:29:04,485
Are you sure?

1016
02:29:04,568 --> 02:29:06,737
Yeah. Sure I'm sure.

1017
02:30:58,974 --> 02:31:01,310
(snoring)

1018
02:34:06,787 --> 02:34:08,956
(grunts)

1019
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:50,080
(horse neighs)

1020
02:35:23,363 --> 02:35:26,324
(Tuco) Haa! Haa!

1021
02:40:55,028 --> 02:40:58,614
It'll be a lot easier with that.

1022
02:41:37,695 --> 02:41:39,864
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

1023
02:41:40,490 --> 02:41:42,575
Dig.

1024
02:41:44,577 --> 02:41:46,287
You're not digging.

1025
02:41:58,758 --> 02:42:03,137
If you shoot me,
you won't see a cent of that money.

1026
02:42:04,013 --> 02:42:05,348
Why?

1027
02:42:08,267 --> 02:42:10,895
I'll tell you why.

1028
02:42:10,978 --> 02:42:13,481
Cos there's nothing in there.

1029
02:42:21,572 --> 02:42:24,825
- Why, you son of a...
- You thought I'd trust you?

1030
02:42:28,204 --> 02:42:31,832
200,000 dollars is a lot of money.

1031
02:42:31,916 --> 02:42:35,044
We're gonna have to earn it.

1032
02:42:37,630 --> 02:42:39,924
How?

1033
02:42:49,892 --> 02:42:52,728
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

1034
02:42:56,524 --> 02:42:58,651
The gun?

1035
02:49:04,516 --> 02:49:08,687
You pig! You wanted to get me killed!
When did you unload it?

1036
02:49:10,689 --> 02:49:12,899
Last night.

1037
02:49:12,983 --> 02:49:17,696
You see, in this world,
there's two kinds of people, my friend:

1038
02:49:17,779 --> 02:49:22,451
those with loaded guns
and those who dig.

1039
02:49:22,534 --> 02:49:24,494
You dig.

1040
02:49:24,578 --> 02:49:26,705
Where?

1041
02:49:36,506 --> 02:49:38,884
Here.

1042
02:49:39,801 --> 02:49:41,678
Unk... Un...

1043
02:49:41,762 --> 02:49:44,681
There's no name on it.

1044
02:49:44,765 --> 02:49:47,476
And there's no name here, either.

1045
02:49:48,769 --> 02:49:51,772
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.

1046
02:49:51,855 --> 02:49:56,651
It was the grave marked "unknown",
right beside Arch Stanton.

1047
02:50:03,450 --> 02:50:05,952
Go ahead.

1048
02:50:19,591 --> 02:50:22,469
(little pants of excitement)

1049
02:51:02,717 --> 02:51:06,471
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!

1050
02:51:22,445 --> 02:51:27,617
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't...
You wouldn't play a joke on me like that.

1051
02:51:27,701 --> 02:51:31,037
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

1052
02:51:31,121 --> 02:51:34,499
I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

1053
02:51:53,435 --> 02:51:55,604
(cross creaks)

1054
02:52:41,650 --> 02:52:45,695
Well, now... Seems just like old times.

1055
02:52:50,283 --> 02:52:52,994
Four for you.

1056
02:52:54,204 --> 02:52:57,332
And four...

1057
02:52:58,500 --> 02:53:01,002
Four for me.

1058
02:53:27,028 --> 02:53:28,446
Hey, Blon...

1059
02:53:28,530 --> 02:53:29,864
Blon...

1060
02:53:38,998 --> 02:53:41,376
Hey, Blondie...

1061
02:53:42,627 --> 02:53:45,338
Sorry, Tuco.

1062
02:53:48,341 --> 02:53:49,717
Blondie...

1063
02:53:58,852 --> 02:54:01,187
Blondie!

1064
02:54:09,028 --> 02:54:11,197
Blondie!

1065
02:54:20,957 --> 02:54:22,041
Blondie...

1066
02:54:32,677 --> 02:54:34,554
Blondie...

1067
02:54:49,736 --> 02:54:52,405
Blondie!

1068
02:55:13,593 --> 02:55:16,471
You son of a bitch...

1069
02:55:18,806 --> 02:55:21,267
Blondie...

1070
02:55:42,121 --> 02:55:44,499
Aaaarhh!

1071
02:56:20,410 --> 02:56:23,579
Hey, Blondie!

1072
02:56:24,455 --> 02:56:27,750
You know what you are?

1073
02:56:30,962 --> 02:56:32,839
Just a dirty son of a...

1074
02:56:32,922 --> 02:56:38,177
(melds into theme music)
